[Rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) and bellows have no significant differences in essence, only some differences in materials, dimensions, and size appearance. They are products that are not of the [rubber shock absorbing block](http://www.smpolymer.com/) category.

Different from the previously mentioned [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), the fundamental difference between the two lies in that the scope of expansion joints is broader than that of bellows. Bellows can serve the compensation function of expansion joints, like what we refer to in reality as bellows compensators and bellows expansion joints. Rubber shock absorbing pads and V-type shock absorbing pads are both widely used in aerospace applications, which is the most prominent aspect of bellows expansion joints.

[Rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) are made from many materials, such as: stainless steel, aluminum, copper, and rubber. Currently, rubber-type expansion joints are quite popular in the market, mainly because of their low cost and convenient installation. Expansion joints not only include bellows, but also rubber expansion joints, compound pulverized coal expansion joints, universal hinge expansion joints, and others.
