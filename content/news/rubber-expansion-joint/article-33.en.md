There are many types of expansion joints. Currently, most manufacturers classify expansion joints based on their displacement forms into axial, lateral, angular, and pressure-balanced types. Today we will focus our research on [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/).

Generally, rubber expansion joints produced now are mostly used in ship holds, installed at the connections of dredging pipelines. Since rubber products have a huge advantage of good extensibility, they are very convenient to install. The materials used have the effect of reducing vibration and lowering noise. [Rubber shock absorbing blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) have such effects. Rubber expansion joints are suitable for various medium and low-pressure pipes, have excellent displacement performance, and can help reduce vibrations generated by large rotating equipment.

Finally, let's discuss the key points to note when installing [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/). The coaxiality deviation between the expansion joint and the pipeline cannot exceed 3mm, to avoid reducing the service life of the expansion joint.
