People habitually prefer to call expansion joints flexible joints or are more commonly referred to as pipeline compensators. [Rubber shock absorbing blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) are a type of compensation device that utilizes the dimensional differences generated by conduits or containers due to thermal expansion and contraction. They not only absorb angular displacement but also reduce noise and absorb vibration.

[Rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) are compensators made from rubber. Using rubber as a material takes advantage of all the characteristics of rubber products. [Silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) have strong sealing properties, rubber shock absorbing blocks have good elasticity and wear resistance, and [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) have plasticity and water resistance.

Based on these characteristics of expansion joints, they can be applied to various industries, such as: medical industry, petroleum, defense industry, automotive industry, etc.
