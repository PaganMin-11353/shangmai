Rubber expansion joints, also known professionally as [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/), have the greatest characteristics of high pressure resistance, balancing pipeline deviation, absorbing vibration, and large displacement capacity, capable of axial, lateral, and angular displacement. They can reduce noise, normally reducing structural noise transmission by 15-30 decibels under normal conditions, which demonstrates very qualified sound insulation effects, and they are also convenient to install.

Among rubber products, [rubber shock absorbing blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), and others may experience natural aging or shrinkage cracking during long-term use. Now these situations will not occur because mesh steel wire is adopted for multi-body protection, fully demonstrating the high temperature resistance and aging resistance characteristics of rubber products.

[Rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) are generally used in water supply and drainage, circulating water, petrochemical, compressor, fan, and other pipeline systems.
