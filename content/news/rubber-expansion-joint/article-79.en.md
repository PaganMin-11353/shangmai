Manufacturing [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) requires a complete set of equipment, and molds are certainly very important during the manufacturing process. Among rubber products, except for semi-finished natural rubber, all others need to be processed into finished products. The structure of rubber expansion joints is relatively simple. The surface of the element is smooth and elastic rubber product, while the interior adopts multiple layers of strong fiber or steel bands (wire) and other reinforcing interlayers that extend all the way to the rubber flanges at both ends, with hard steel wire framework inside the flanges.

Also being rubber products, the function of [rubber shock absorbing blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) can also be demonstrated here. Anti-vibration and sealing effects are also characteristics that influence rubber products, and their high and low pressure resistance performance is particularly good.

The function of [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) is to compensate for some errors. Due to their soft texture, they are also convenient for installation. The selected materials are relatively sturdy, so there's no need to worry about quality issues. Such expansion joints have sales in the market that far exceed those of other industries.
