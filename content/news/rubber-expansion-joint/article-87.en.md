[Rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) can perform expansion and contraction functions, mainly relying on bellows to achieve this. The design and combination of bellows must be relatively standardized, and material selection must follow national standards. [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [rubber shock absorbing blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) differ in material selection and can be manufactured into various types, including acid-resistant, alkali-resistant, corrosion-resistant, and high-temperature resistant varieties. The rubber expansion joints produced this way all have the advantage of adapting to various media and environments.

Rubber expansion joints can greatly reduce vibration and noise in pipeline systems, and can fundamentally solve problems of interface displacement, axial expansion and contraction, and concentricity issues caused by errors. Because [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) have relatively good pressure resistance capability, when encountering excessively high pipeline pressure, limit bolts should be used to connect the flanges at both ends together.

Rubber products are relatively soft, lightweight, have good sealing performance, are convenient to install, and have long service life.
