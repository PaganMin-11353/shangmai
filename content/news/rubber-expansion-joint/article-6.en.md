When materials undergo thermal expansion and contraction, thermal stress is generated, which can damage equipment. [Rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) are designed to eliminate the load that thermal stress brings to equipment, thereby protecting the equipment. Rubber expansion joints have much higher working pressure than joints made of other materials, and their quality is superior. Due to the vulcanization process used in rubber expansion joints, they possess: high elasticity, high airtightness, media resistance, and radiation resistance. Shanghai Shangmai Rubber Factory specializes in producing rubber products such as: [rubber shock absorbing blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), and other pressure-reducing rubber products.

The greatest application characteristic of rubber expansion joints is their significant displacement compensation capability, along with the ability to reduce vibration, lower noise, and provide certain anti-corrosion capabilities, making installation convenient and labor-saving.

Due to their excellent extensibility and flexibility, rubber expansion joints are widely used in pipeline systems for compressors, ships, water pumps, and other applications.
