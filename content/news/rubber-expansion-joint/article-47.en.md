Although the installation of [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) is simple, it still requires great care. Before installation, what needs to be done first is to check whether the selected expansion joint model and specifications meet the design requirements of the pipeline configuration. Then check whether the flow direction of the expansion joint is consistent with the flow direction of the medium in the pipeline. This is done to allow the expansion joint to operate normally in the pipeline and reduce vibration.

[Rubber shock absorbing blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) are also used to reduce vibration, but their uses are not very similar. Rubber shock absorbing blocks are mostly used in automotive equipment, while [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) are mostly used in pipelines, so the installation process is also different.

After installation, for some high-pressure, high-temperature steam pipe systems, it is necessary to test whether the installation was successful. The operation is very simple: open the drain port to eliminate accumulated water or medium.
