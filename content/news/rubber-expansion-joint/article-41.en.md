Rubber compensators are the abbreviated name for [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/), sometimes also called rubber flexible joints. The construction of rubber expansion joints is very simple. The metal flanges used typically adopt matching loose sleeve structures. On the surface of the compensator components is a layer of rubber products, while the inner layer uses strong fiber or steel wire to reinforce the intermediate layer extending to the rubber flange, making such rubber expansion joints more advantageous in compensation effects.

Many similar rubber products, such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [rubber shock absorbing blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/), all have sealing properties and are used as auxiliary materials for making compensators.

Usually, [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) are used in heat exchange equipment and pipelines to absorb thermal deformation of metallic materials and reduce thermal resistance, protecting the service life of equipment.
