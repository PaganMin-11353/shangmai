Regarding the application range of [rubber expansion joint](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) products from rubber factories, engineers from Shanghai Shangmai Rubber Factory have mentioned this in previous articles. We are already very familiar with the application ranges of products like [rubber shock absorbing blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) or [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/). Now let's analyze in detail the related application ranges of rubber expansion joints.

Different from small sealing rubber products like [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), rubber expansion joints can be widely applied in boiler plants, cement plants, steel plants, thermal power plants and nuclear power stations, air conditioning ventilation systems, glass and mineral wool industries, petrochemical enterprises, air and gas cleaning operations, fan factories, and other locations. Among these, rubber expansion joints for power plant smoke and coal pipelines have good reverse displacement (change) recovery properties, can provide compensation in smaller multi-dimensional directions, and can effectively eliminate multi-directional errors generated during pipeline installation and connection.

Duct rubber expansion joints have superior sound absorption and vibration reduction functions, effectively reducing and eliminating the transmission of noise and vibration from boilers, fans, and other systems. Duct rubber expansion joints have minimal force transmission losses, reducing design procedures without the need to add other auxiliary facilities. Duct rubber expansion joints and insulation materials have high heat resistance and corrosion resistance performance, never rust, reducing maintenance costs. Duct rubber expansion joints have excellent airtightness and flexibility, ensuring no leakage of transported media and restoration to original condition after repeated displacement!
