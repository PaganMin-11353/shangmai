Different from [rubber shock absorbing blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/), often, [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) are composed of end pipes, brackets, flanges, conduits, and bellows that constitute their working main body, belonging to a type of compensation element. Similar products include silicone sealing rings and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), all utilizing their ability to absorb dimensional changes in pipelines, conduits, containers, etc., caused by thermal expansion and contraction, or to compensate for axial and angular displacement changes. Unlike products such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), they can also be used to reduce noise and vibration, generally used in modern factories.

Rubber expansion joints can be classified into: rubber expansion joints, non-metallic expansion joints, and many other types. The main function of non-metallic expansion joints is to ensure safe pipeline operation, with compensation effects being most prominent. Their large expansion capacity facilitates convenient installation and removal of valve pipelines. They have strong vibration absorption capability, can reduce equipment vibration wear on pipelines, and extend equipment service life.

Marine expansion joints generally adopt thin-wall multi-layer structure with high flexibility and low stiffness. Products mostly adopt flanged structure, offering corrosion resistance, high temperature resistance, aging resistance, no leakage, long service life, and are non-toxic.
