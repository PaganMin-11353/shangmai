Expansion joints are mainly applied in heat exchange equipment and pipelines to compensate for stress caused by uneven thermal forces. [Rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) use natural rubber in their construction. Rubber expansion joints are formed by directly connecting rubber tubes with two flanges, representing a new type of pipe fitting connection method. They are thin-wall pipe fittings with corrugated surface appearance, possessing high axial elasticity, compensating displacement to the maximum extent, isolating vibration, with high pressure bearing capacity, low stiffness, and relatively long service life.

Each type of rubber expansion joint has its own advantages and disadvantages, such as: [rubber shock absorbing blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), so appropriate selection should be made according to different usage conditions to ensure normal operation of expansion joints, achieving economical and reasonable design selection of rubber expansion joints.

[Rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) are used for axial compensation of pipelines, with large compensation capacity, possessing strong self-guiding and superior anti-bending capabilities, thereby simplifying the design of pipeline guide supports and allowing arbitrary installation of guide support spacing.
