This type of expansion joint gets its name because it has no constraints on many compensators and can freely compensate for the spacing between all supports in the pipeline. The most basic type of this expansion joint is still the [rubber expansion joint](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/). This shows the role of rubber in our lives, from small household items to large defense industries, playing a significant role. Similar rubber products include [rubber shock absorbing blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/). Current unrestricted expansion joints are mainly used for axial compensation in pipelines, with relatively large compensation amounts, strong bending resistance, and the ability to use multiple layers.

The technology of the 1980s certainly couldn't compare with today's, and the rubber expansion joints produced had many defects, with serious twisting, bending, and instability phenomena. Today's high technology uses advanced techniques, and the expansion joints produced have strong support and directional performance.

Manufacturing [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) requires high quality and excellent service to continuously meet the demands of domestic and international markets, striving to achieve the best.
