Previously, Shanghai Shangmai Rubber Factory has explained much knowledge about rubber products for everyone, including professional analysis of [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), exclusive technical analysis of [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/), and some application knowledge about [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/). Today we will discuss: Introduction and performance analysis of [flexible rubber joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/kequnaoxiangjiaojietou/). First, let's understand the general situation of flexible rubber joints.

Flexible rubber joints also have other names such as [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/), [rubber soft joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaoruanjietou/), or simply called soft joints. It is a rubber product with very high durability characteristics. It has good elasticity and excellent sealing properties. What are its performance characteristics?

First, the characteristic of flexible rubber joints is that their overall size is not large, and they are lightweight, with convenient installation features.

Second, during actual construction and assembly processes, they can produce different angle tensions, demonstrating the high elasticity of flexible rubber joints.

Finally, it is emphasized that flexible rubber joints have excellent durability and temperature resistance, making them the preferred accessories for connecting industrial pipelines and other equipment.
