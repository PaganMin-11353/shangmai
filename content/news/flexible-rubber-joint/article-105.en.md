The pressure of various types of flexible rubber joints is the design pressure Pd (MPa) at t=20℃. The pressure range typically ranges from vacuum to 4MPa. For special ultra-high pressure requirements, we can also design specifically according to silicone sealing rings and related [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) design methods.

Before each flexible rubber joint product leaves the factory, every process undergoes 100% pressure testing and other required inspections, meeting standard requirements before being allowed to leave the factory.

Depending on different customer operating conditions, other materials can also be used for manufacturing. When the connecting pipes and liner tubes of flexible rubber joints are made of carbon steel, the operating temperature range of flexible rubber joints is -20℃ to 420℃; when the connecting pipes and liner tubes are made of stainless steel (same as bellows), the product's temperature range is -196℃ to 700℃.
