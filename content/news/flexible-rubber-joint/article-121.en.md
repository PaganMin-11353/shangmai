The phenomenon of physical and mechanical property deterioration of [flexible rubber joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/kequnaoxiangjietou/) under long-term effects of sunlight, heat, oxygen, ozone, and atmosphere is called aging. The cause of flexible rubber joint aging is due to oxidative chain reactions of rubber molecules, with light and heat energy accelerating these reactions. The aging coefficient is expressed by the ratio of physical and mechanical properties after and before aging of rubber subjected to aging treatment.

Hot air aging, similar to [silicone sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/) tests, is designed to detect changes in physical properties such as hardness, tensile strength, and elongation at break of rubber after artificial aging at certain temperatures. Standards: GB 3512-83, ISO 188.

For hot air aging of flexible rubber joints, attention should be paid to the following points: ① Aging chamber model. ② Aging test temperature, time, and cycles. Aging temperatures for [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) can be selected as 50℃, 70℃, 100℃, 120℃, 150℃, 200℃, 300℃, etc. Aging time can be selected as 24, 48, 72, 96, 144h or longer. ③ Sample types. The test uses dumbbell-shaped tensile specimens. A minimum of ten samples, with five flexible rubber joints tested before aging and five tested after aging.
