Compression set of [flexible rubber joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/kequnaoxiangjiaojietou/) is a very important indicator for moving parts, such as rubber suspension rings and rubber bushings. Compression ratio, test temperature, and test time are all relatively important parameters. Standards: GB 7759-91, ISO/R815.

For compression set testing, attention should be paid to the following points: ① Sample types for flexible rubber joints: Type A: Sample diameter 29±0.5mm, height 12.5±0.5mm cylindrical specimen. Type B: Sample diameter 13±0.5mm, height 6.3±0.5mm cylindrical specimen. Samples can be cut from thin rubber sheets and then stacked. Stacked samples should not exceed three layers. When test results for both sample types are inconsistent, the obtained test results cannot be compared with each other. For measuring rubber compression set, Type A samples are preferred, as larger samples can provide higher precision data. When samples are taken from finished products, Type B samples are preferred, and samples should be taken from the center of the product as much as possible.

② Preparation methods for flexible rubber joint samples: 1. [Silicone sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/) compression molding method to prepare samples, vulcanization temperature, vulcanization time. 2. Die-cutting method to prepare samples.

③ Test conditions. Table 3-2 High and low temperature test temperatures: [Rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) High temperature (℃) / Low temperature (℃): 40±1 / 0±1, 55±1 / -10±1, 70±1 / -25±1, 85±1 / -40±1, 100±1 / -55±1, 125±2 / -70±1, 150±2 / -80±1, 175±2 / -100±1, 200±2, 225±2, 250±2.

Compression ratio, test [V-type sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/) temperature, time, liquid name: Compression ratios of 50%, 20%, and 10% can be selected. Test temperature: Room temperature testing is conducted at 23±2℃. Other temperatures are shown in Table 3-2. Test times include: 24-26h, 72-74h, 168-170h, or multiples of 168h. ④ When conducting liquid resistance tests, the type of liquid must be specified. ⑤ Cooling time and standing time. Cooling time is generally 30-120min, standing time is 30min.
