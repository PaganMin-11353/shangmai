Most [flexible rubber joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/kequnaoxiangjiaojietou/) have varying degrees of flammability. Rubbers containing halogens in their molecules, such as chloroprene rubber, fluorine rubber, and [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), have certain flame retardant properties. Therefore, chloroprene rubber and chlorosulfonated polyethylene containing chlorine atoms are difficult to burn even after external flames are removed, while [fluorine rubber tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) are completely self-extinguishing. Adding flame retardants (such as phosphates or halogen-containing substances) to rubber compounds can improve their flame retardancy.

The main properties and testing techniques of flexible rubber joints include the following indicators: Shore A hardness, density, tensile strength/elongation at break, hot air aging, compression set, brittle temperature, resilience, ozone resistance, tear strength, abrasion resistance, liquid resistance testing, paint resistance, etc.

There are many testing methods for flexible rubber joints, such as GB, ISO, DIN, etc. Based on plastic experience, the development direction is mainly ISO standards, and possibly [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) also follow ISO standards mainly, but this doesn't matter much. For flexible rubber joints, unlike plastics, there's no particular emphasis on specimen or experimental method issues. For our company's standards, flexible rubber joint testing methods are mainly based on national standards (GB standards), with DIN standards (German industrial standards) not used very frequently, and generally [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) standards are universal with GB and ISO standards. Therefore, GB standards are mainly used here, with reference to ISO standards.
