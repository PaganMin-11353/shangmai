In our previous article, we discussed "Introduction and Performance Analysis of [Flexible Rubber Joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/kequnaoxiangjiaojietou/)". Looking back at the previous article, everyone may already have a general understanding of flexible rubber joints (also called "[Rubber Soft Joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaoruanjietou/)"). This article will simply describe the scope and instructions for flexible rubber joints!

1. Usage scope of flexible rubber joints: With their superior durability and other characteristics, flexible rubber joints have been widely used in various industries. For example: chemical metallurgy, construction heavy industry, some power grid systems, etc.

2. Usage instructions for flexible rubber joints: During the use of flexible rubber joints, corresponding support brackets are needed for both end pipelines as auxiliary support to prevent detachment. Also, when fixing, all corresponding support components should be much greater than their longitudinal and transverse tension forces, with the purpose of preventing detachment.

Therefore, flexible rubber joint products have completely surpassed the previous [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and related applications of [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/), becoming the new favorite in the rubber industry.
