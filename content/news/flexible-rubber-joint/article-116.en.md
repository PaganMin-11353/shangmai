1. First, let's discuss the electrical properties of [flexible rubber joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/kequnaoxiangjiaojietou/): General-purpose flexible rubber joints are excellent electrical insulators. Natural rubber, butyl rubber, ethylene propylene rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber all have good dielectric properties, so flexible rubber joints, like [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), have been widely used in insulated cables and other applications. Nitrile rubber and chloroprene rubber have poor dielectric properties due to the presence of polar atoms or atomic groups in their molecules. On the other hand, incorporating conductive fillers such as conductive carbon black or metal powder into flexible rubber joints gives them sufficient conductivity to dissipate static charges, or even makes [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) conductive.

2. Now let's discuss the permeability of flexible rubber joints: The gas permeation rate of flexible rubber joints is the product of gas solubility and diffusivity in rubber. Gas solubility decreases as the rubber's solubility parameter increases, and the diffusion rate of gas in flexible rubber joints depends on the number of side chain groups in the rubber molecules. The gas permeation rates through various flexible rubber joints differ greatly. Among rubbers like [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), polyether rubber and butyl rubber have low gas permeability, with butyl rubber's gas permeability being only 1/20 that of natural rubber. Silicone rubber has the highest gas permeability. Rubber's gas permeability increases rapidly with temperature rise. For products using carbon black as filler, the variety and filling amount have little impact on gas permeability. However, the amount of plasticizer has a significant impact on the gas permeability of vulcanized rubber. For flexible rubber joint products with high gas permeability requirements, it's best to minimize the amount of plasticizer used.
