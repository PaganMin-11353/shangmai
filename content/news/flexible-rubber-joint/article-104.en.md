Flexible rubber joints, also known as [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) or non-metallic compensators, share similarities with traditional [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/), and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/). They possess the following characteristics:

        1. Multi-directional compensation: Flexible rubber joints can provide large axial, angular, and lateral displacements within a relatively small size range. 2. No thrust reaction: The main material is glass fiber fabric and its coating products, with no force transmission. Using non-metallic compensators simplifies design, eliminates the need for large supports, and saves significant materials and labor. 3. Sound dampening and vibration reduction: Fiber fabrics and insulation cotton inherently possess sound-absorbing and vibration-dampening properties, effectively reducing noise and vibration from boilers, fans, and other systems. 4. Excellent high-temperature resistance, corrosion resistance, and sealing performance: Flexible rubber joints are treated with high polymer materials such as organic silicon and fluorine, providing excellent high-temperature resistance, corrosion resistance, and sealing performance. 5. Convenient installation and maintenance. In terms of applications, flexible rubber joints are widely used in: 1. Thermal power plants: boilers, gas turbine exhaust systems, dust removal systems. 2. Petrochemical enterprises: boilers, industrial furnace exhaust desulfurization devices, wet and dry ventilation ducts. 3. Steel mills: blast furnaces, converters, exhaust systems, and dust removal systems. 4. Smelting plants: combustion furnace supply and exhaust systems. 5. Cement plants: kilns, dust collection, and smoke treatment system devices. 6. Equipment categories: dust collectors, absorption towers, air heaters, blower inlet and outlet equipment.
