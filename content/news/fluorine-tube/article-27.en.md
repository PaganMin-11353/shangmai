The structural composition of [fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) is: fluorine atoms on the main and side chain carbon atoms, forming synthetic high-molecular elastomers. Fluorine tubes belong to new high-molecular materials, with characteristics different from [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), possessing superior heat resistance, oil resistance, and solvent resistance properties, with excellent performance well-suited for rubber product supply and demand in the automotive industry.

Currently abroad, the production status of [fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) is as follows:

The main producing countries for fluorine tubes are the United States, Germany, Italy, and others. Below is an introduction:

Generally speaking, fluorine tubes, like the previously introduced [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), face the contradiction between poor coordination of raw rubber processing performance and the physical properties of vulcanized rubber. Therefore, synthesis requires broadening the molecular weight distribution range, all to solve heat stability-related mechanical properties.

Fluorine tubes developed in the United States are mainly used for gaskets, O-ring fluorine tubes, and oil seal fluorine tubes, primarily featuring low-temperature flexibility performance.
