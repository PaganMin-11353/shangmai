Manufacturing high-pressure hoses follows the same process as manufacturing [fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/). In recent years, the production process for hydraulic oil pipes using plastic as the main raw material has been appropriately simplified. Due to the low cost of rubber products, most rubber factories still use rubber as raw material to produce fluorine tubes, though manufacturing hoses requires many raw materials and complex production processes. The manufacturing of general rubber products is quite similar, such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/).

Fluorine tubes have excellent oil resistance, heat resistance, and aging resistance. The tube body bonds tightly, withstands high pressure, and has superior bending and pulse resistance. They are suitable for a wide range of media and are safe to use with long service life.

[Fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) are suitable for mechanical industries such as coal mining, petroleum, metallurgy, and aviation, used in hydraulic systems to transport petroleum products with certain pressure and temperature.
