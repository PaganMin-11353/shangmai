In the components of products across many industries, [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), brake diaphragms, leather bowls and dust covers, [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) are all rubber products. Rubber products are highly regarded across various industries for their unique vibration-damping function!

Future development priorities should adopt [fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) and polyester fabric as framework materials to manufacture fuel pressure regulator diaphragms for automobiles; use chlorinated polyethylene to manufacture automotive diaphragms.

For dust cover materials, the most important requirement is good weather resistance. Constant velocity joints generally use chloroprene rubber, but with improved heat resistance performance, the application of polyolefin thermoplastic elastomers is gradually increasing. In Europe and America, most automobiles use polyolefin thermoplastic elastomers to manufacture dust covers. This type of [fluorine tube](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) rubber product not only meets the requirements for weather resistance, oil resistance, and heat resistance, but can also achieve automotive weight reduction.
