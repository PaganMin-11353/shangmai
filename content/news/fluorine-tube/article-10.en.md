Compared to rubber products such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/), the material of [fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) is still considered relatively new. Fluorine tubes are also a type of high molecular elastic material.

Under conditions with large temperature differences, fluorine tubes still maintain excellent resistance to high and low temperatures, capable of withstanding use under various complex conditions.

In addition to the above characteristics, [fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) also have excellent stability, resistant to ultraviolet rays and radiation. Furthermore, they offer oil resistance and solvent resistance. During use, they consistently maintain superior high-temperature radiation resistance performance. Regardless of operating conditions, they always maintain excellent elastic characteristics and exceptional stability. Due to these properties, such products are highly regarded by professionals in the rubber industry!
