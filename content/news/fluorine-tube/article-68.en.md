With the continuous improvement of requirements for reliability and safety in the automotive industry, the use of [fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) in automobiles is also rapidly growing. Due to fluorine tubes' characteristics of high temperature resistance, oil resistance, and resistance to corrosion from various chemicals, they are widely used in high-end technologies such as aviation, automotive, chemical, and petroleum industries.

The earliest fluorine rubber was trial-produced in the United States, using butadiene and its copolymers with styrene, propylene, etc., but the performance was not significantly better than chloroprene rubber and butyl rubber, and the price was expensive. In the late 1950s, binary nitroso fluorine rubber resistant to strong oxidants emerged, and fluorine rubber began to enter practical industrial applications. Since then, with technological progress, various new types of fluorine rubber have been continuously developed. Initially used in aerospace and defense military applications, they have now gradually expanded to civilian industrial sectors.

Later product extensions also saw the emergence of many silicone products, such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), which have had far-reaching impacts on light and heavy industries.
