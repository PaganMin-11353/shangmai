General high-pressure hoses use nitrile rubber as the main raw material, with the greatest characteristic being excellent oil resistance. [Fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) are made by adding special reinforcing agents to the raw materials and mixing them into synthetic rubber, which has also appeared in [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/). The outer rubber layer uses synthetic rubber with superior weather resistance. High-pressure hoses have good oil resistance, heat resistance, and aging resistance, can withstand relatively high pressure, and have a wide range of applicable media including petroleum-based liquids, water-based liquids, gases, and other media.

The greatest characteristic of fluorine tubes is safety during use and relatively long service life. The external structure is fine and dense, free of mechanical impurities, with high strength and excellent chemical stability. They can be processed into various shapes with guaranteed quality.

[Fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) use specially made high-grade polytetrafluoroethylene soft tubes and high-temperature resistant braided mesh, suitable for special environments with high temperature, corrosion, and high pressure.
