A thin film containing fluorine atoms is coated on the inner layer of the hose, providing protection for the hose. This is [fluorine tube](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) made with high-tech synthetic materials. This type of product is widely used in the automotive manufacturing industry, with excellent heat resistance, gasoline resistance, and low fuel permeability. Low fuel consumption is a great advancement for the automotive manufacturing industry and society as a whole, not only reducing fuel consumption but also reducing harmful gas emissions. Fluorine tubes have made significant contributions to the civilization of society.

[Fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) adopt nanotechnology with extremely strong high-temperature resistance, changing ordinary petroleum transportation hoses to a new inner rubber layer polymerized from high-temperature resistant thermal rubber. [Silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) have all adopted update and replacement methods.

While modifying original standards, new functions have also been added, increasing automotive output power and extending engine working life.
