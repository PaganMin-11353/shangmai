Regarding [fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/), they are currently widely used in the rubber industry. Shanghai Shangmai Polymer Materials Co., Ltd. provides the following analysis regarding the development prospects and outlook for fluorine tubes:

According to incomplete statistics, by the end of 2010, China's total consumption value of raw materials for [fluorine tube](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) type rubber products will be approximately 1.2 million tons. The frequency of product updates and replacements is increasing rapidly, and accordingly, the application of new materials, new processes, and new technologies for fluorine tubes is becoming increasingly mature. In fact, the prospects and future status of the fluorine tube production industry are closely related to the stability of social production materials. In this diverse fluorine tube industry, due to its high industrial investment nature, it has always been at the forefront of the entire rubber product industry chain!

The prospects for the fluorine tube production industry should be positioned as an important basic industrial category, including industry subdivisions that encompass rubber products such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/). Their application fields will be distributed across medical, light industry, daily use and other rubber industry categories, and will have far-reaching impacts on the development of various production equipment assembly industries, including transportation, machinery, electronics and other heavy industries.

In summary, due to the product characteristics of fluorine tubes, we can predict that the future development prospects and application scope of the fluorine tube industry will be extremely broad!
