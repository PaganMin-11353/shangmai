High and low pressure hydraulic hoses are composed of steel wire braided hoses and steel fittings. [Fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) are a relatively significant material that can ensure the circulation of liquids in various hydraulic components and the transmission of liquid energy. Fluorine tube fittings connect with hoses in crimped and detachable forms, with no restrictions on hose length, and the connection forms with pipeline systems are divided into several types, providing manufacturers with more choices.

Like [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/), they have oil resistance and excellent weather resistance. This excellent rubber product uses copper-plated steel wire braiding for reinforcement, with relatively high pressure-bearing capacity, and [fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) also have good bending and pulse resistance.

Due to high-temperature resistance, they are suitable for high-pressure transportation of media such as mineral oil, water-based hydraulic oil, and water. The surface is smooth, and the black color appears simple and elegant.
