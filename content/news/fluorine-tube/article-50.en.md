[Fluorine tube](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) is a synthetic rubber containing fluorine atoms, a new type of high-molecular elastic material with excellent high and low temperature performance and good physiological stability. As a sealing material, fluorine rubber has the same function as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), with good sealing performance. Fluorine tubes can withstand repeated harsh sterilization conditions, have excellent resilience, and relatively small deformation.

The main characteristics of fluorine tubes include excellent oil resistance and solvent resistance. They can dissolve in aliphatic, aromatic, and chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents, various petroleum-based fuel oils, hydraulic oils, and certain synthetic oils such as ester lubricating oils.

[Fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) are mainly used in aviation, chemical, petroleum, automotive and other industrial sectors as fluorine rubber medium-resistant materials and insulation materials.
