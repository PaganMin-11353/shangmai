There are many types of hoses, but adding fluorine atoms to high-molecular elastomers is relatively rare. Such hoses have superiority in use, with particularly good high-temperature resistance and heat oil resistance. The greatest characteristic of fluorine atoms is excellent chemical resistance and corrosion resistance, capable of working in the harshest environments. They cannot be replaced by many rubber products, and [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/) do not have as significant an effect as [fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/).

Fluorine tubes have incomparable superiority and many excellent properties, making their applications relatively widespread. Due to their high-temperature resistance, they can be used in petrochemical, automotive and other mechanical industries. Their stability to organic liquids, acids, alkalis and other chemicals is superior to rubber products.

For high-performance [fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/), the selection of many product materials also has first-class production formula technology, so manufacturing requirements are also relatively strict.
