Continuing from the previous article "Related Introduction to [Fluorine Tube](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) Rubber Products Part 1", the previous introduction about [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/) was very clear. Now let's specifically discuss some characteristics of fluorine tubes:

In the past, during 1970-1980, DuPont developed fluorine tube elastomers, while Daikin Corporation in Japan and the former Soviet Union also developed such products.

Different from [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and others, it has the heat resistance and chemical stability of polytetrafluoroethylene. The tetrafluoroethylene-propylene copolymer chemical structure of the new fluorine tube, such as GF 205NP, truly functions to reduce costs; it also does not require lead oxide compounding, has excellent steam and acid resistance, and has a wide range of fuel resistance. It provides reliable sealing under various temperature tests.

Looking at today, the development history of [fluorine tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/fujiaoguan/) is also worth noting. Internationally, industrialization mainly focuses on polyolefin fluorine rubber and other types of fluorine tube rubber products as main products. We believe that in the near future, higher quality fluorine tube high-molecular materials will be improved and developed!
