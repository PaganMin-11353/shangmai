The production process of [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) can be roughly divided into three parts: monomer synthesis and purification, polymerization process, and rubber post-processing. The basic raw material for rubber shock absorber blocks is monomers, and commonly used purification methods include distillation, washing, and drying.

The polymerization process is where monomers undergo polymerization reactions under the action of initiators and catalysts to generate polymers. Sometimes one polymerization equipment is used, and sometimes multiple units are used in series. The polymerization processes for rubber shock absorber blocks mainly use emulsion polymerization and solution polymerization methods. Currently, emulsion polymerization is used for styrene-butadiene rubber, isoprene rubber, butadiene-propylene rubber, butyl rubber, [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/), etc.

[Rubber damping pad](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) post-processing involves treating materials after polymerization reaction (latex or rubber solution) through steps including removal of unreacted monomers, coagulation, dehydration, drying, and packaging to finally produce finished rubber products. The coagulation process for emulsion polymerization mainly uses electrolytes or polymer coagulants to destroy the emulsion and precipitate rubber particles. The coagulation process for solution polymerization is mainly hot water precipitation. The rubber particles precipitated after coagulation contain large amounts of water and require dehydration and drying. According to their applications, synthetic rubbers are classified into general-purpose synthetic rubber and specialty synthetic rubber.
