Regarding the practical applications of [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/), this is the 2nd lecture. The molecular structure of rubber shock absorber blocks has the following characteristics: ① Their molecules consist of long-chain molecules composed of repeating units (chain segments). The molecular chains are flexible with highly active chain segments, and the glass transition temperature (Tg) is below room temperature; ② Due to the relatively small intermolecular attractive forces (van der Waals forces) of [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/), they are amorphous under normal conditions (stress-free) and molecules can easily move relative to each other; ③ Some parts between molecules can be connected through chemical crosslinking or physical entanglement, forming three-dimensional network molecular structures to limit the large-scale mobility of entire macromolecular chains. From a microscopic perspective, the atoms and chain segments of long-chain molecules composing [rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) are in constant motion due to thermal vibration, causing the entire molecule to exhibit extremely irregular random coil shapes, with the distance between molecular ends being much smaller than the extended length.

An unstretched piece of rubber is like a tangle of curled linear molecules. When rubber is not subjected to external forces, its undeformed state has maximum entropy. When rubber is stretched, its molecules align in rows to varying degrees in the stretching direction. Work must be done to maintain this oriented arrangement, so rubber resists being stretched. When external forces are removed, [flexible rubber joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/kequnaoxiangjiaojietou/) will contract back to the state of maximum entropy. Therefore, rubber's elasticity is mainly "entropy elasticity" originating from changes in entropy within the system.
