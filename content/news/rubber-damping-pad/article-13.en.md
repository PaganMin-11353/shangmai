Nowadays, [rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) are becoming increasingly popular and widely used in electric locomotives, railway locomotives, and other mechanical power systems. Due to the damping characteristics of rubber products, they can adapt to high-frequency vibration conditions. The greatest advantage of rubber products lies in their shock resistance and excellent sealing performance, such as the [rubber shock blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) manufactured by Shanghai Shangmai Rubber Factory.

Since rubber damping pads are not sensitive to water and dust, they do not experience sudden ruptures during use, making them reliable, safe, and long-lasting in operation.

Perhaps everyone would be surprised to learn that rubber damping pads can also improve drainage. Since [rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) are made from natural rubber, they have excellent anti-slip and oil-resistant properties, providing certain hydrophobic and anti-slip functions.
