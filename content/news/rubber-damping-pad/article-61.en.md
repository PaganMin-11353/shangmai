As is well known, machine tools generate strong vibrations and significant noise during operation. At this time, we need an accessory that can prevent vibration and noise. [Rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) enable us to understand that they can provide shock-proof and sound-insulating effects. [Rubber shock blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) also have shock-proof and sound-insulating functions. Being rubber products with the same internal material composition but different external shapes, this is completely different from products like [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/).

Therefore, in large factories with operating machinery, even when you walk beside them, you won't feel any vibration sensation. It's all due to the rubber damping pads working, protecting both the machines and the physical and mental health of workers, making them high-quality mechanical auxiliary materials.

Such [rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) are also convenient to install. You only need to tighten the screw level when the machine tool is horizontal, fixing it in a horizontal state, so the machine tool can work safely.
