Rubber products all share some common characteristics: they can withstand high and low temperatures, have excellent sealing performance, and have outstanding sound insulation effects. With so many advantages, their applications are naturally quite extensive. [Rubber shock blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) have the same properties, both belonging to rubber products, and are quite similar in their applications.

When transporting fragile items like glass, [rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) should be placed under the glass bottom. Their main function is to prevent breakage and provide protection.

There's an issue that many people cannot understand: why do many wooden manufacturers claim that using wooden blocks as motor cushions is most suitable, even better than using rubber blocks? In fact, manufacturers haven't considered that when wooden blocks are in humid environments for long periods, they absorb moisture and deform, and are prone to rot. From a safety perspective, wooden blocks can also conduct electricity when damp. Overall, rubber blocks are better to use.
