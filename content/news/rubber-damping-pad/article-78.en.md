There are many rubber products, and in today's modern technological innovation, [rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) are applied across various industries. The most widely used application is still in the automotive industry. Damping pads generally serve as pressure reduction and vibration resistance, but this effect cannot be replaced by other materials. [Rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) all have vibration dampening functions, ensuring normal operation of cars and other machinery, and extending machine service life.

[Rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) use chloroprene rubber and nitrile rubber. These two types of rubber have relatively wide applications. Due to quality assurance, many automotive parts manufacturers are also very satisfied and willing to purchase such rubber damping pads.

In addition to being popular in the automotive parts industry, they can also thrive in machine tools and computer industries.
