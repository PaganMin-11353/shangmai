Noise is directly generated by resonance. During the operation of a computer case, the case itself acts as a sound-generating body. [Rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) are components used to reduce vibration. Don't underestimate these pads - they have significant applications and are mostly used on computer cases. They can reduce friction between the case and power supply port, first protecting the service life of the case, and secondly, rubber shock blocks can also extend by reducing vibration and prolonging the service life of the case.

Damping pads are generally classified by material quality into: [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/). Although both are rubber products, silicone naturally has superior shock absorption effects and is also priced higher.

Damping pads have the function of adjusting machinery, with a large adjustment range that is convenient and quick, and installation is particularly convenient.
