According to engineers from Shanghai Shangmai Polymer Materials Co., Ltd., [rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) have many advantages compared to other damping pad products: they offer high freedom in shape design, similar to [rubber shock blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), and besides having damping functions, they also provide multiple performance benefits including cushioning and sound insulation.

[Rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) use many varieties of rubber, mainly natural rubber and styrene-butadiene rubber. To improve the heat resistance of damping products, nitrile rubber (NBR), chloroprene rubber (CR), butyl rubber (IR), and ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber (EPDM) are also used. Different rubber materials are typically selected based on different operating environments and application requirements, or multiple rubbers are combined, and certain modification methods are employed to enhance specific properties of the rubber materials.

Rubber damping pads can also be designed structurally to meet impact force requirements in all directions. They also possess excellent energy absorption properties. Besides good damping effects, rubber damping pads have low wear rates, are easy to maintain, lightweight, and convenient to install and remove, making them widely applicable in various fields including building materials and automotive industries.
