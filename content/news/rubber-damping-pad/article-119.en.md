The tensile testing experiments for [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) mainly include tensile strength, rubber shock absorber block fracture strength, elongation at break, rubber shock absorber block stress at definite elongation, elongation at definite stress, yield point tensile stress, yield point elongation, and permanent set after rupture. Standards: GB/T 528-92, ISO/DIS 37-1990. When conducting rubber shock absorber block tensile tests, pay attention to the following points: ① Type of specimen (different from [V-type sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/)). Specimens include dumbbell-type specimens (as shown in Table 3-1) and ring specimens. Table 3-1 Dumbbell-type Tensile Specimens: Type 1, Type 2, Type 3, Type 4 - Total length (minimum) L: 115, 75, 35, 50; End width We: 25±1, 12.5±1.0, 6.0±0.5, 8.5±0.5; Narrow parallel section length Ln: 33±2, 25±1, 12.0±0.5, 16.0±1.0; Narrow parallel section width W: 4.0±0.1, 2.0±0.1, 4.0±0.1; Measured [rubber damping pad](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) transition edge outer diameter Ro: 14±1, 8.0±0.5, 3.0±0.1, 7.5±0.5; Measured rubber damping pad transition edge inner diameter Ri: 25±2, 12.5±1.0, 3.0±0.1, 10.0±0.5; Rubber shock absorber block initial gauge length: 25.0±0.5, 20.0±0.5, 10.0±0.5, 10.0±0.5; Rubber shock absorber block specimen thickness mm: 2.0±0.2, 2.0±0.2, 1.0±0.2, 2.0±0.2. When cut from products, thickness may vary, but results between different thicknesses are not comparable. Ring specimens are Ф44.6±0.2mm with inner diameter 36.6mm. Thickness 4.0±0.2mm. ② Specimen preparation methods: Ring specimens can be cut by stamping once or twice, or cut by rotary method on molded rubber sheets. Additionally, they can be prepared directly using molding methods. ③ Rubber shock absorber block test conditions: Type 1 and 2 test tensile speed is 500±50mm/min. Type 3 and 4 test tensile speed is 200±20mm/min. Ring specimen tensile speed is 500±50mm/min.
