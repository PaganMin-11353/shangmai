Various rubber products differ in quality due to different material selections. Recently, a material that has become popular in the market is nitrile rubber, characterized by oil resistance, aging resistance, and long service life. [Rubber shock blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) both use such high-tech materials, with shock absorption effects much better than damping pads made from other materials. Strong quality assurance has made them highly sought after by many mechanical industries.

[Rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) have characteristics of strong versatility and wide application range in usage techniques. Pit-type rubber damping pads are designed with upper and lower convex shapes to bear heavy loads, making the bearing area increase as the load increases.

Pit-type [rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) have particularly good elasticity, capable of effectively dispersing and absorbing vibrations from any direction. Under horizontal force action, the circular convex platform plays a braking role.
