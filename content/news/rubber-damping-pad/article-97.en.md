Rubber products are generally soft and suitable for use between two hard objects to reduce friction between them and protect equipment to function normally. [Rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) are mainly used in industrial and automotive manufacturing to reduce vibration and noise. The latest developed [rubber shock blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) are superior in performance and applications, effectively solving practical problems. [Silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) only serve a sealing function, while rubber damping pads can work under high pressure.

Rubber damping pads solve the problem of equipment damage caused by vibration to a certain extent. The surface of rubber damping pads is smooth with bright and rich colors. They are generally installed above switches near heating elements, which facilitates harmony between the board and the bracket.

[Rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) come in various forms and can be manufactured according to the requirements of different products, which can save both costs and resources.
