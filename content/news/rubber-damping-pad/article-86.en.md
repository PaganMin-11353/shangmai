Spring damping pads are mostly used in automobiles. Due to the good elasticity of springs, when cars travel on bumpy roads, the vehicle body doesn't experience much fluctuation. [Rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) installed under seats can raise the vehicle body height, reducing pressure on drivers. The biggest benefit of rubber damping pads is reducing pressure on shock absorbers when driving on rough roads, protecting expensive shock absorbers while preventing excessive vehicle body sinking and chassis collisions. [Rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) also have these advantages, reducing pressure and providing better protection for vehicles.

General companies that professionally produce rubber products will choose high-quality materials for processing and manufacturing. The produced rubber damping pads have characteristics of good elasticity and toughness, effectively dampening vibrations from various machines.
