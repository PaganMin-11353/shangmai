First, the raw material of sound insulation damping pads is rubber, mainly based on [rubber shock blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/). The characteristic of damping pads is that they have particularly good sound blocking effects against impact sounds across the entire frequency range, and can most effectively isolate impact noise and airborne noise. They are mainly applied to floor sound insulation in places with strong noise sources such as factories, home theaters, and discos, and are generally used in commercial centers or floors connected to entertainment venues.

[Rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) use high-density foaming, with perforation rates that are carefully designed. They are very effective in sound insulation, vibration damping, waterproofing, and mold resistance. Made from environmentally friendly materials, they can be considered eco-friendly equipment during use, and installation is convenient requiring only cutting tools.

They also have a long lifespan, lasting up to about 30 years. Quality can be improved, and in the future, [rubber damping pads](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaojianzhendian/) will be increasingly applied in our daily lives.
