There are many types of rubber tubes, all with the same structural type, differing only in material selection, which determines that the manufactured tubes have different performance and applications. Here we focus on introducing [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/). Unlike [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) in shape, they use raw rubber, air rubber, silicone, and methyl vinyl in material selection. They can be produced through general molding or standard molding, and some silicone tubes can also be formed through extrusion.

The high-temperature resistance of silicone tubes is beyond our imagination. Environmental protection and non-toxicity are their greatest advantages. High transparency allows them to be applied in daily life and as drainage tubes in medical equipment. They are also widely used in aerospace applications. Silicone tubes have good extensibility and can be up to 100 meters long.

[Silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) have small outer diameter tolerances, are oil-resistant, heat-resistant, lightweight, and have soft yet durable tube bodies. Their minimum burst pressure is four times the working pressure.
