The manufacturing of [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/) utilizes silicone's characteristics of strong adsorption capability to quickly and effectively absorb moisture within sealed packaging, chemical stability, and non-toxicity and harmlessness. Combined with continuous innovation and development in recent years, various silicones have been extensively used in drug purification, DNA separation, food drying, high-precision electronics, high-end cosmetics, sewage purification, beer purification, high-grade coatings, and resin production or storage. In our daily life and production activities, products such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/) can be widely applied. This is mainly manifested in the following aspects:

Dry anti-mold packaging for precision optical instruments and electronic appliances;

Leather drying applications, such as placement in leather clothing, leather bags, and leather shoes to provide drying and quality preservation;

Food drying applications, commonly seen in cookies and fried foods to ensure food crispiness;

Pharmaceutical drying applications, placed in medicine bottles to ensure extended storage life of medicines;

Container drying: Shipping containers at different latitudes will form "internal rain" inside the container. If you use silicone desiccant, it can absorb moisture equivalent to its own weight. During ocean transportation processes lasting up to 50 days, it can effectively lower the dew point and control container condensation phenomena.

Hotel supplies, such as placement in wardrobes, shoes, and under beds to absorb various odors and maintain dry and fresh air.
