There are many types of silicone products, all utilizing their good oil resistance, temperature resistance, and ozone resistance properties. [Silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) manufactured this way are generally applied in automotive, electronics, chemical, sports equipment, and medical devices. [Silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) are non-toxic, harmless, odorless, and resistant to both cold and high temperatures. This is incomparable to rubber products. The superiority of silicone products is also reflected in design techniques - from past hand extrusion to current compression molding, it is the drive of technology and innovative thinking that motivates people's research into silicone products.

Good processing performance and easy molding advantages allow the production of various products through extrusion hot air vulcanization molding, compression molding, calendering molding, and other methods.

Due to [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) having excellent comprehensive performance and good technical-economic effects, they have gained widespread applications in aviation, aerospace, atomic energy, electrical, instrumentation, machinery, metallurgy, medical and health, and daily life fields.
