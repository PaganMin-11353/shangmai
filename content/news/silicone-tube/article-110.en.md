In the previous lecture, we discussed [silicone sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/) fundamentals - Lecture One. The main content of this lecture is the classification knowledge of rubber products such as [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [flexible rubber joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/kequnaoxiangjiaojietou/).

Generally speaking, rubber such as silicone sealing rings is classified into natural rubber and synthetic rubber by raw materials, into general-purpose rubber and specialty rubber according to performance and use, and into hard rubber and soft rubber, raw rubber and vulcanized rubber according to the physical state of rubber.

Silicone sealing rings are made from the latex secreted by artificially cultivated rubber trees, obtained through coagulation and processing. Their main component is polyisoprene.

Past experience tells us that the polyisoprene content in silicone sealing rings is above 90%. In addition, [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) also contain small amounts of proteins, lipids and acids, sugars, and ash.

According to different manufacturing processes and shapes of silicone sealing rings, the global production areas of [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) are mainly concentrated in a few Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, India, and Sri Lanka, and a few African countries such as Nigeria. In China, production areas are mainly distributed in Hainan, Yunnan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian regions. Among them, the total natural rubber production of Hainan and Yunnan accounts for approximately 60% and 35% of the national total production respectively. Due to natural rubber's strong elasticity and good insulation, plasticity, waterproof and gas-proof, tensile strength and wear resistance characteristics, silicone sealing rings are widely used in industry, agriculture, defense, transportation, machinery manufacturing, medicine and health, and daily life, such as tires used in transportation; conveyor belts, transmission belts, and various [rubber soft joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaoruanjietou/) used in industry; gloves and blood transfusion tubes used in medicine; rubber shoes, raincoats, and hot water bottles used in daily life - all manufactured with rubber as the main raw material. Defense applications including aircraft, cannons, tanks, and even cutting-edge technology fields like rockets, satellites, spacecraft, and space shuttles all require large quantities of rubber components. Tire usage accounts for more than half of silicone tube rubber consumption.
