[Silicone sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/) fundamentals - Lecture One mainly introduces the compositional knowledge of polymer materials such as silicone sealing rings.

Generally speaking, rubber products such as silicone sealing rings and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) belong to a type of polymer material, which is mainly divided into three parts: plastics, rubber, and fibers.

Rubber is an organic polymer elastic compound. Its molecular weight is generally above hundreds of thousands, with some even reaching around one million. Its characteristic is high elasticity - rubber easily deforms under external forces and quickly returns to its original shape when the external force is removed. This characteristic is not possessed by other materials and is the main distinguishing feature of rubber from other materials. In addition, silicone sealing rings also possess certain mechanical strength, shock absorption and vibration absorption capabilities, as well as excellent properties such as extremely high flexibility, wear resistance, waterproofing, and air-tightness. Some special silicone sealing ring rubber types also have characteristics such as oil resistance, chemical corrosion resistance, heat resistance, cold resistance, flame resistance, aging resistance, and radiation resistance.

These excellent properties of silicone sealing rings make rubber widely applicable in daily life, such as hoses, [flexible rubber joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/kequnaoxiangjiaojietou/), rubber beads, sealing strips, [rubber soft joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaoruanjietou/), rubber gaskets, etc. In the automotive industry, there are widespread applications in chassis, engine, body, fuel supply, cooling, braking, and transmission systems. Main applications include automobile tires, hoses, belts, sealing products (including O-rings, oil seals, and various gaskets), sealing strips, [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/), shock absorbers, cups, diaphragms, [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/), dust covers, etc.

Due to the unique high elasticity of silicone sealing rings, rubber applications in automobiles are often irreplaceable by other materials. According to statistics, there are more than 100 rubber components used in automobiles, accounting for approximately 4%-6% of the total vehicle weight. These rubber products all play important roles and have crucial effects on overall vehicle quality, performance, and safe driving.
