There are many types of rubber tubes, and the main method to distinguish them is by the manufacturing materials. [Silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) are made from silicone. The main material of silicone is still a combination of rubber and new materials, so the price is much higher than rubber products. [Silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) cost much more than [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/). Now when discussing prices, everything needs to be calculated carefully because society is progressing.

The biggest characteristic of silicone tubes is high temperature resistance, non-toxic, harmless, and odorless, making them most suitable for small appliances such as: coffee pots, electric kettles, rice cookers, sterilizers, water dispensers, thermal cups, etc.

Among rubber tube products, there is also fire-resistant [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/), manufactured through scientific formulation and advanced processing technology, featuring flame resistance, high pressure resistance, high temperature resistance, and environmental protection characteristics.
