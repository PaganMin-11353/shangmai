There are many silicone products, such as: [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/), etc. Silicone may be slightly higher in price than rubber, and this statement is well-founded, because silicone is synthesized from rubber and various rubber products, which inevitably involves some processing components. Today, let's first introduce silicone tubes and their various applications.

Silicone tubes are rubber products that use high-tech materials, inheriting all the excellent advantages of rubber products. [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) are high-temperature resistant, low-temperature resistant, and have good physiological stability. Their radiation resistance is excellent, making them great assistants for manufacturing wires and cables. The applications of silicone rubber are also quite extensive, capable of meeting the needs of defense, military, and various other aspects. In aviation, applications are most widespread, such as: sealing rings for hydraulic oil system pumps, oil seals, and various flame-retardant silicone rubber components.

[Silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) are produced in many colors, providing customers with more choices, and quality should be emphasized when making selections.
