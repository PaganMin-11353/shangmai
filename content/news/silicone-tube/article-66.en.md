Rubber tubes are conduits used to transport gases, liquids, and paste-like or granular substances. Because they all share the same characteristics of excellent sealing properties, [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) have become mainstream tubes in industry, agriculture, and high-tech industries in recent years. [Silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) have been pursued and loved by many manufacturers. Silicone tubes are widely used in agricultural irrigation due to their characteristics of easy bending, cushioning capability, light weight, and convenient installation.

Modern silicone tubes are classified into many types. Those used for general agricultural production are ordinary silicone tubes, while those used in pipeline industries are generally flame-retardant silicone tubes and high-temperature resistant silicone tubes. Due to advances in science and technology, through research by silicone research experts, there are also medical silicone tubes and food-grade [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/).

People are paying more and more attention to the improvement of technological quality. Modern rubber tube production processes tend toward highly continuous and automated production. Using thermoplastic rubber or plastic can eliminate the vulcanization process, greatly simplifying the production process. Perhaps in the near future, silicone products may replace knitted rubber tubes and fabric-reinforced rubber tubes.
