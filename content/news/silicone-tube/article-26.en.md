Senior engineers from Shanghai Shangmai Rubber Factory have introduced that [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) and other rubber extruded products, unlike [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and previously introduced [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), have different manufacturing processes. Silicone tubes are made by using extruder pressure to force rubber compound through the die head forming molds, creating various cross-sectional shaped rubber semi-finished products. After initial shaping, they are cooled and set, then sent to the vulcanization system for high-temperature vulcanization or used as pre-formed semi-finished rubber compounds required for compression molding.

[Silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) and other rubber extruded products are characterized by high efficiency, stable quality, and the ability to achieve automated production compared to other production methods. It is worth noting that during the heating and vulcanization process of silicone tubes and other rubber extruded products, the rubber compound undergoes deformation and crosslinking internally, generating thermal expansion forces. During the cooling process of vulcanized rubber compounds, stresses tend to be eliminated, and the linear dimensions of silicone tube rubber compounds shrink proportionally.

Therefore, in the mold design for silicone tubes and other rubber extruded products, the dimensions of the forming parts need to be correspondingly enlarged, with shrinkage rates generally expressed as percentages.
