In the previous articles, we discussed knowledge about [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/). This time, we will introduce the functional overview of silicone tube welding machines. Please read below!

[Silicone tube](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) welding machines are powerful tools for welding and cutting various silicone tubes in sterile environments. They enable the connection of two different containers and facilitate the complete transfer of internal liquids.

Some people may ask, what exactly are the functions of silicone tube welding machines, especially their scope of application? Here are the details:

The applicable scope of silicone tube welding machines includes liquid transfer in various sterile environments, liquid replenishment when bioreactors are low on fluids, and sample collection.

In addition, other features of [silicone tube](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) welding machines include: suitable for silicone tube welding and other applications, unique design, and mobile verification and printing of reports.
