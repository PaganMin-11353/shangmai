There are many types of [silicone tube](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) connectors, including: sealing tubes, food-grade silicone tubes, medical silicone tubes, pharmaceutical silicone tubes, flame-retardant tubes (strips), and high-temperature resistant silicone tubes. They are applied in various industries of life, with excellent high-temperature resistance performance. They can be used continuously at 200°C and can also be used at -60°C. Like [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), they still maintain elasticity at low temperatures. The medium performance of silicone rubber is extremely good, greatly exceeding ordinary organic rubber at high temperatures.

Long-term outdoor use will not cause cracking phenomena, possessing excellent weather resistance, ozone resistance, and UV radiation resistance. General silicone tube connectors can be used normally outdoors for more than 20 years.

Due to the relatively hard material of [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/), they can permanently deform under high-temperature compression and can be widely used for supporting electronic, automotive, medical, and other mechanical products.
