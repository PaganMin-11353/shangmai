According to technical personnel from Shanghai Shangmai Rubber Factory, in recent years, the production and development of [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and other rubber products industry has been rapid, with increasingly subdivided industry categories. Products like silicone sealing rings face more and more environmental and peripheral support issues!

Therefore, it is necessary to understand not only [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/), silicone sealing rings, but also various [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and other rubber factory products' characteristics and classifications.

People know that the rubber raw materials used in rubber factory production belong to polymer materials, with the characteristic of high elasticity, making it an elastic substance. Rubber can be classified by its source into: synthetic rubber and natural rubber. Synthetic rubber refers to products manufactured using chemical synthesis processes, while natural rubber refers to rubber obtained from plant sources. The above are the characteristics of silicone sealing rings and other rubber products.

For the classification of silicone sealing rings and other rubber products, there are the following contents. According to different characteristics, they can be divided into polar rubber products and non-polar rubber products, or crystalline rubber products and non-crystalline rubber products. Silicone sealing rings and other rubber products are formed under high pressure, resulting in some shrinkage and instability. Without a period of stabilization or relaxation, these rubber products easily experience dimensional deviations, causing serious quality degradation of rubber products.
