In today's world of abundant material life, environmental protection and health are advocated everywhere - in diet, daily necessities, and surprisingly, even in mechanical products. [Silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) are the most environmentally friendly and pollution-free among silicone products. After strict SGS testing, it was also found that [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) also have environmental protection characteristics. In material selection, they absolutely do not exceed the prescribed range of standard silicone products, being 100% completely non-toxic and odorless.

[Silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) are frequently seen in our daily lives. Due to their excellent high temperature and high pressure resistance properties, they are widely used in some small household appliances (water heaters, electric kettles, rice cookers) and also in the electronics industry. Most importantly, they are used as drainage tubes in medical equipment, contributing to the development of human health services.

Their pressure resistance is also quite strong, providing protection for machinery when working under high pressure.
