With the development of China's rubber products industry, the variety of rubber products is increasing daily. Products such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/), and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) are expanding in production volume, driving the evolution of rubber product mold design and manufacturing from traditional experience-based design to theoretical calculation design.

Especially with the continuous improvement of rubber production equipment such as [silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) and the constant advancement of production processes, rubber product molds are becoming increasingly numerous, with manufacturing levels and mold complexity becoming higher and more sophisticated.

High efficiency, automation, precision, and long service life have become the development trends for rubber molds!

The parting surface of molds for silicone tubes and other rubber products should try to avoid the working surfaces of the products as much as possible. The selection of parting surfaces for rubber products of the same type must consider product removal.

Whether silicone tubes and other rubber products can be removed depends on the product thickness, cross-section, and inner diameter size.

The greatest characteristic of parting surface selection for silicone tubes and other rubber products is that the parting surface is selected on the non-working surfaces of the product, or on the edges, corners, and curved protrusion surfaces of the product. For products with protrusions at edges or curved intersections, the parting surface should generally be set at the edge or curved intersection.
