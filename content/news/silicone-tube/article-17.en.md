Silicone bellows tubes mainly adopt [silicone tube](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) materials. Generally, this type of silicone tube has a wide range of applications, involving transportation, medical and health, electrical communications, and daily necessities. Due to silicone rubber's strong high-temperature resistance and extremely high stability, it can be used to manufacture high and low temperature products in both hot and cold conditions, similar to [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/), possessing strong high-temperature resistance. This is also a common characteristic of many rubber products.

[Silicone tube](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) rubber products can accelerate heating and reduce power requirements. Although they have strong stability, they do not lose flexibility. They can be easily adhered through vulcanization, adhesives, or fasteners, making them simple and easy to install.
