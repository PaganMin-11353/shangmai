Common [silicone tube products](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) include [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and others. Unlike [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), their main raw materials include raw rubber, various compounding agents, and fiber and metal materials as reinforcement materials. The basic production process of rubber products includes six fundamental procedures: mastication, mixing, calendering, extrusion, molding, and vulcanization. The rubber processing workflow is primarily about resolving the contradiction between plasticity and elasticity. Through various processing methods, elastic rubber is transformed into plastic masticated rubber, then various compounding agents are added to create semi-finished products, which are then vulcanized to transform the plastic semi-finished products back into rubber products with high elasticity and excellent physical-mechanical properties.
