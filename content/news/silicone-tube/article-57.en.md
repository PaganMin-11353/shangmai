[Silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) can be classified into silica gel tubes, platinum silicone tubes, bio-pharmaceutical silicone tubes, etc. Currently, silica gel tubes are used the most. Unlike [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), their service life is relatively limited, but they have particularly good toughness, can be slightly stretched, have smooth inner walls, and strong plasticity.

The performance of silicone tubes is similar to ordinary silicone products, with excellent resistance to oxygen, ozone, and ultraviolet radiation, leading to widespread use in the construction industry. They are mainly applied in the automotive industry, with low toxicity and low chemical reactivity. Although they do not have hydrophobic functions, they can still repel water and have good sealing performance. [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) can also achieve effective sealing effects.

[Silicone tubes](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaoguan/) made from such high-quality materials are very useful, generally used for supporting electronic industry, medical equipment, and other mechanical products.
