Sealing products come in many material types. According to the materials used for manufacturing seals, they can be divided into silicone sealing products and rubber sealing products. According to pressure bearing capacity, they can be divided into medium-low pressure static sealing rings and high pressure static sealing rings. Here we will study silicone sealing products: [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/). Similar to these are [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/).

Silicone sealing strips use graphite, polytetrafluoroethylene, and various sealing adhesives suitable for sealing materials. They have flexibility for bonding with sealing surfaces, good aging resistance, low friction coefficient. [Silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) have appropriate mechanical strength and hardness, excellent corrosion resistance, can work long-term in acidic, alkaline, and oil media, are not easily adhered to metal surfaces, and have good high and low temperature resistance - not easily decomposing at high temperatures and not easily hardening at low temperatures.

Currently used sealing products are generally applied in defense, chemical, coal, petroleum transportation, and mechanical manufacturing industries, and are also widely used in automotive basic parts and accessories.
