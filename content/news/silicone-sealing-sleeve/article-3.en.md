[Silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) as a type of rubber product, not only have excellent wear resistance, but also have particularly strong elasticity and tear strength. Similar to [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), they are also suitable for manufacturing vibration-damping components and other products, with wide practical applications in industries such as automotive brake components.

Silicone sealing strip products have uniform quality, few impurities, pure composition, and truly possess good wear resistance. However, due to their relatively weak resistance to high pressure, they can be produced and used together with other rubber products.

In addition to the above characteristics, silicone sealing strip products also have excellent corrosion resistance and super compression properties. They have very stable resistance under atmospheric conditions. Generally, [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) and silicone sealing ring products manufactured by rubber factories have better wear resistance and aging resistance compared to traditional vibration-damping products.
