Sealing strips produced from silicone rubber have a transparent and smooth appearance. In terms of design, processing [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) and flange rings perform well in drying equipment, especially on dryer doors where the effect is even better, with a service life more than three times that of ordinary rubber sealing components. [Rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) can only reduce friction caused by vibration in machine configurations to a certain extent, while silicone sealing strips can provide a sealing effect at specific positions.

[Silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) have good ozone resistance and solvent resistance, and also perform well in electrical insulation. Therefore, they are widely used in chemical, medical, food, and electronics applications. Due to their significant UV resistance, they are also applied in pharmaceutical flow guidance.

The main function is excellent sealing performance, suitable for long-term use at high temperatures below 260°C.
