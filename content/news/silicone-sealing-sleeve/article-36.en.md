Among the many types of silicone products, [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) are also quite popular. Silicone products have excellent sealing performance, smooth appearance, and good high-temperature resistance, with maximum temperatures reaching 280°C, which other silicone products cannot achieve. Similar to this are [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), which both perform very well in electrical insulation.

[Silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) are widely used in chemical, pharmaceutical, food, electronics, and mechanical industries, utilizing the advantages of silicone products' ozone resistance and solvent resistance. They are also applied in pharmaceutical flow guidance and electronic wire and cable processing. They perform particularly well on dryer doors, with good elasticity and a service life more than three times that of ordinary rubber sealing components. They are non-toxic and bromine-free, making them the first choice for many manufacturers.

Shanghai Shangmai [Rubber Factory](http://www.smpolymer.com/) will produce various styles of silicone products according to customer needs. Service first, innovation and development - this is also the company's service philosophy.
