[Silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) use a new type of high-molecular elastic material with excellent high and low temperature resistance. [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) also have such good physiological stability. [Silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) can withstand repeated harsh and disinfection conditions. All these are features that silicone sealing component products possess, with excellent resilience and small permanent deformation, good ozone resistance and UV resistance. Silicone sealing strips also have oil resistance properties.

Silicone sealing strips can dissolve in certain hydraulic oils, petroleum-based aromatic and chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents, and have good stability at room temperature. [Silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) have excellent high-temperature radiation resistance, maintaining elasticity even when gamma rays reach as high as 1×10⁹ roentgens.

Most are used in industry, transportation hubs, and medical equipment, and aerospace industry is also somewhat involved.
