Currently, the energy used in China's construction industry mainly relies on reinforced concrete. Compared to sealing strips, this is indeed a case of the tail wagging the dog. However, [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) are still loved by many businesses, mainly because current energy consumption is too high, and some resources are non-renewable. Therefore, we need to create alternative materials that can replace non-renewable resources. [Silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) all have such properties. Considering the excellent sealing performance of silicone and rubber products, they are widely used in construction for sealing between window frames and glass, especially between window frames and window sashes.

Sealing strips in the market have quality differences, which consequently lead to price differences. So when purchasing sealing strips, attention should be paid to their surface appearance. Quality superior sealing strips can meet standard specifications, while rubber strips with poor elasticity, easy hardening, pungent odor, and easy migration causing frame yellowing are all substandard products.

[Silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) made from EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) material are a new material developed in recent years, mainly used in the construction industry.
