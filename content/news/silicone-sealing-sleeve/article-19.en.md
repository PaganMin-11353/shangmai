Silicone rubber has better heat resistance, electrical insulation, and chemical stability than other ordinary rubbers. Common products include [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/), etc.

Unlike [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/), silicone rubber is a new type of high-molecular elastic material with excellent high and low temperature resistance, good physiological stability, and can withstand repeated harsh and disinfection conditions. It has excellent resilience and small permanent deformation, ozone resistance, UV resistance, and radiation resistance characteristics. Therefore, it is widely used in various fields. Among them, silicone sealing rings are widely used in applications requiring heat resistance, such as thermos bottle sealing rings, pressure cooker rings, etc.

Shanghai Shangmai Polymer Materials Co., Ltd. is a medium-sized private enterprise integrating scientific research, development, and sales, specializing in the production of [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/), silicone tubes and other rubber products. In recent years, its main products have been widely praised by customers in various fields.
