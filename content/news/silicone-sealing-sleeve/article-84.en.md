The main component of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is polyvinyl chloride itself, and its fire resistance performance is relatively good. The characteristic of [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) is good sealing performance, while [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) do not have as good fire resistance as silicone sealing strips. PVC is a synthetic material that can be manufactured according to the needs of various manufacturers. There are many colors available for us to choose from, and it is corrosion-resistant, strong and durable.

[Silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) have added a series of auxiliary agents such as anti-aging agents and plasticizers during the processing process, enhancing the heat resistance and corrosion resistance of silicone sealing strips. The humanization aspect is quite prominent. In addition, PVC material silicone sealing strips are relatively inexpensive, have good physical properties, and high plasticity.

Fire-resistant materials still carry considerable weight in sealing products. Combined with the characteristic of bright colors, this further enhances the aesthetic appeal.
