Sealing strips have the functions of sound insulation, dust prevention, water seepage prevention and vibration reduction. With the development of the automotive industry, requirements for automotive aesthetics and comfort are becoming increasingly high, and the mechanical and electrical configurations and accessories inside vehicles have also attracted attention from many people. The characteristic of [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) is that they have good elasticity and compression deformation resistance. Since the material for producing sealing strips is EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer) rubber, which has excellent weather resistance, heat resistance, ozone resistance, and UV resistance, current automotive sealing strip production uses this EPDM material.

Automotive [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) are designed for different parts, and there are also [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) designed for small automotive sealing components. General automotive sealing strips are used for doors, windows, engine compartments, etc.

For sealing strip maintenance, when washing the car, there will always be some sand and dust between the [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/). At this time, you should use a brush to clean the sand and dust thoroughly rather than replacing it with other tools. Only in this way can the service life of the sealing strips be extended.
