Sealing strips also come in handy when decorating houses. In winter, people hope to live in a draft-free environment, and this is when [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/) can showcase their strengths. The key to sealing is mainly on doors and windows, as well as balcony sealing. For aesthetic reasons, most people now choose frameless balcony windows, allowing them to enjoy sunlight in winter without worrying about UV intensity. When encountering circular cylindrical objects, you need to choose [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) for sealing.

Sealing strip materials are generally silicone, PVC+silicone. Silicone sealing strips are soft but may discolor; PVC+silicone doesn't easily discolor but is harder and may crack. So when purchasing, everyone should first understand these characteristics of [silicone sealing strips](http://www.smpolymer.com/guijiaomifengtiao/).

Additionally, attention should be paid to sealing in kitchen decoration. Water leakage around the sink should not be ignored, requiring both aesthetic appeal and practicality.
