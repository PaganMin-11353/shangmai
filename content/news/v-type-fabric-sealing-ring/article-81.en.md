When installing [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), first check the surface quality of the sealing components. A qualified sealing component has a smooth exterior and good elasticity. Some [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) with quality issues have rough surfaces, flash, and even cracks. Proper sealing components must meet standard requirements in geometric dimensions and precision, rejecting all defects such as pores and porosity. Due to their high elasticity, don't worry during installation - just be careful.

During assembly, we have used a screwdriver to press the sealing lip along the cylinder diameter inward; or used fine wire to tie the outer lip of the V-type fabric sealing ring tightly, making its outer diameter smaller than the cylinder's inner diameter, then sending the sealing ring into the cylinder and pulling out the fine wire.

Taking advantage of the low sliding friction resistance of [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/), good wear resistance, and long service life, they are widely used in printing, semiconductor, automation control, and other machinery equipment.
