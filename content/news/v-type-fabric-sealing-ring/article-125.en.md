[V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) include: upper V-shaped ring surface, inner ring surface, outer ring surface, arc-structured ring groove, and lower V-shaped ring surface structure. Located on both sides of the upper V-shaped structure of the sealing ring, the inner ring surface connects with the inside of the upper V-shaped ring surface, the outer ring surface connects with the outside of the upper V-shaped ring surface, the lower V-shaped ring surface is located on both sides of the lower V-shaped structure of the sealing ring, connecting respectively with the inner ring surface and outer ring surface, and the arc-structured ring groove is located at the lower end of the upper V-shaped ring surface, connecting with the lower end structure of the upper V-shaped ring surface.

Due to the use of practical new materials, the sealing performance of electric pneumatic airless spray machines has been greatly improved, achieving the purpose of high-performance sealing of piston components in electric pneumatic airless spray machines and extending the service life of sealing components.

This solves the problems of poor sealing performance and short service life of V-type leather [sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) in piston components of existing electric pneumatic airless spray machines. It has very strong creativity and practicality, thus having very broad market prospects.
