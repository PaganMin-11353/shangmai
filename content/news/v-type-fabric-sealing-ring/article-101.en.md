[V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) are a branch product of [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/). The selection of parting surfaces for fabric-reinforced and fabric-embedded products in V-type fabric sealing rings differs from [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) in that: V-type fabric sealing rings must consider both the placement and filling of V-type fabric sealing ring compound with fabric materials, as well as the compression and consolidation of V-type fabric sealing ring compound with fabrics.

In addition, the parting surface of V-type fabric sealing rings differs from products like [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/). V-type fabric sealing rings must have appropriate embedding depth. The commonly used embedding depth H = 3-6mm. For V-type fabric sealing rings with polyester yarn products, the shrinkage rate is generally 0.4-1.5%; for products with nylon yarn and nylon fabric, the shrinkage rate is generally 0.8-1.8%. The more fabric layers, the smaller the shrinkage rate.

Rubber products lined with metal inserts have small shrinkage rates and shrink toward the metal direction, with shrinkage rates generally between 0-0.4%.
