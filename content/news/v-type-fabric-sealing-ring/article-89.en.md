[V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) are the most robust sealing rings among sealing products. Their materials use high-performance synthetic materials such as nitrile rubber with fabric, fluoroelastomer with fabric, rubber-plastic with fabric, and polytetrafluoroethylene, with fiber fabric embedded inside. They can work normally under harsh conditions, have a relatively long service life, and good wear and pressure resistance. They can be optimally combined to suit various heights and applications, and can work even under poor surface quality conditions. They have strong pressure resistance and are suitable for applications with rapidly changing pressure.

[V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) have slightly weaker performance compared to [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/), mainly in material selection, while their sealing properties are similar. Both can be used in hydraulic oil, water, chemical solutions, and other media, with strong extrusion resistance. Due to size considerations, they can be customized by manufacturers according to size requirements.
