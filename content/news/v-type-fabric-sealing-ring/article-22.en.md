Generally speaking, unlike the previously mentioned [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), the commonly referred [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) are mostly used in hydraulic machinery, bearing high working pressures, thus requiring their rubber compound to possess sufficient strength, oil resistance, aging resistance, good wear resistance, low compression set, and certain elasticity.

Additionally, as the working pressure of hydraulic cylinders continues to increase, besides using high-hardness rubber compounds, many [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) feature fabric-reinforced structures to withstand higher working pressures. For fabric-reinforced components, the rubber-fabric compound requirements include good wear resistance and elasticity, while requiring strong bonding between rubber and fabric, high adhesion between fabric layers, good molding processability, and no blooming during storage. Anti-aging agent BLE, polyesters 421 and 832, adhesives RH and RE are respectively added to the rubber compound to improve the adhesion between rubber and fabric or metal. V-type fabric sealing rings generally use high-hardness rubber compounds, and can also adopt methods of blending nitrile rubber with certain plastics, such as: nitrile rubber with PVC blend, nitrile rubber with low-pressure PE blend, etc. These plastic-blended rubber compounds not only maintain the oil resistance of nitrile rubber but also improve weather resistance, aging resistance and other properties. The optimal blending ratio is generally 70:30.
