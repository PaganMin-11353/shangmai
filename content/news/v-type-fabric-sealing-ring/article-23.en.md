Previously, we have introduced rubber products such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/). This article mainly focuses on introducing the extended product of V-type sealing rings - [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/). The cross-section of V-type fabric sealing rings is V-shaped, with a standard included angle of 90°.

In special applications, [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) also use 60°. The support ring is an important component that supports V-shaped sealing rings, with a thick and sturdy cross-section and precise dimensions. When working pressure is very high, several V-shaped sealing rings can be stacked together for simultaneous use. Through pressure, several V-shaped sealing rings combine into a whole. Even if pressure passes through the first V-shaped ring, the pressure will be greatly reduced. After passing through the second V-shaped ring, the pressure is reduced once more. Continuing this way, pressure decreases progressively, and finally, leakage is prevented.

[V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) can only function in one direction. When used as reciprocating piston seals, two symmetrically placed sets of V-type sealing rings should be used. In this case, the piston dimensions are greatly extended, and friction resistance also increases. V-type sealing ring materials are mainly nitrile rubber and neoprene rubber. Natural rubber is used for sealing water and air, butyl rubber for non-flammable hydraulic oil and phosphate ester hydraulic oil. Chlorinated rubber is used for various chemicals and high temperatures. When wear resistance is required, polyurethane rubber is used.
