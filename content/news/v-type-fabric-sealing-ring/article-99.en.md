What are the common major production processes for [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/)? As we all know, our common similar products are [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) and other rubber products. For other rubber products such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/), vulcanization is the final processing step in their production process. Vulcanization is a crosslinking process where rubber macromolecules transform from linear structure to network structure under specific conditions. There are three vulcanization methods: cold vulcanization, room temperature vulcanization, and hot vulcanization. Most rubber products use hot vulcanization. Hot vulcanization equipment includes vulcanization autoclaves, plate vulcanizers, etc. In addition to the above two types of vulcanization, the production processes for rubber products also include impregnation, coating, spraying, calendering, and other methods.
