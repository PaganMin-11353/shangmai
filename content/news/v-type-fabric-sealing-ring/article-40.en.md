When [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) and other rubber products undergo compression molding, they experience high pressure compression. Due to the cohesive forces inherent in elastic bodies that cannot be eliminated, extremely unstable shrinkage often occurs when demolding after molding (rubber shrinkage rates vary depending on the rubber type). Molded products such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) also experience this condition and must undergo a period of time before stabilizing gradually.

Therefore, when designing V-type fabric sealing ring rubber molded products initially, both the formulation and molds require careful calculation and coordination. Otherwise, it is easy to produce products with unstable dimensions, resulting in poor product quality.

[V-type fabric sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) rubber molded products are generally used on flat vulcanizing presses, where molds are easily damaged, rubber loading is inconvenient, and vulcanization time is long. They are generally used for small rubber products and sample molds.
