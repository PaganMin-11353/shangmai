V-type fabric sealing rings are composed of rubber and coated fabrics, which are then molded through compression to form [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/). Typically, sealing rings produced by rubber factories consist of three components: support ring, sealing ring, and pressure ring. Due to different requirements in working length, diameter, and high-temperature resistance strength, they can be stacked for use. The manufacturing requirements for bore seals or shaft seals are very strict.

Excellent sealing performance is also found in [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/). These sealing rings are particularly convenient to install, allow for large extrusion gaps, and have exceptional impact pressure resistance.

Generally, [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) are made from nitrile rubber and cotton fabric, and can be used with hydraulic oil, water, and emulsions.
