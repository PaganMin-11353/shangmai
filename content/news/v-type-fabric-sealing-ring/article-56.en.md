The number of [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) depends on the sealing pressure level. Generally, higher pressure requires more rings, but using more rings doesn't necessarily improve sealing performance. With more rings, the axial dimension increases, friction resistance becomes greater, and lip wear capacity also increases. Therefore, during use, the compression force of the pressure ring must be adjusted frequently to ensure optimal sealing performance. Similar sealing rings include: [Silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/).

V-type sealing rings use three types of materials: pure rubber, fabric-reinforced rubber structure, and plastic composite. These rubber materials each have advantages and disadvantages, depending on different operating environments. With some technical improvements, the service life and sealing performance of [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) can be enhanced.

Sealing rings made of rubber or fabric-reinforced rubber can undergo significant deformation without crushing. However, this deformation inevitably causes corresponding changes in the sealing ring, affecting sealing performance, so special care must be taken during use.
