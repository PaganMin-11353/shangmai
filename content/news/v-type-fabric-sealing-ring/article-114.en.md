The relationship between [V-type sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/) deformation and temperature, deformation speed, and time is as follows: The deformation movement of rubber molecules cannot be completed instantaneously because intermolecular attractive forces must be overcome by atomic vibrational energy. When V-type sealing ring temperature decreases, these vibrations become less active and cannot quickly break intermolecular attractive forces, thus [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) deform slowly. At very low temperatures, vibrational energy is insufficient to overcome attractive forces, and rubber becomes a hard solid.

If the V-type sealing ring temperature is constant but deformation speed increases, it can produce the same effect as lowering the V-type sealing ring temperature. Under extremely high deformation speeds, rubber molecules do not have time to rearrange and will behave as a hard solid. Under stress action, rubber material molecular chains will be slowly destroyed, producing "creep," where [V-type fabric sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) deformation gradually increases. When the deformation force is removed, this V-type sealing ring creep forms small irreversible deformation, called "permanent deformation."
