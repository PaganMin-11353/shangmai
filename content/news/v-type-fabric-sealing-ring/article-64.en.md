There are many types of [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/), including: [Silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/). Different V-type fabric combination sealing rings have subtle differences in application range. They adopt a fabric-reinforced structure, molded from rubber and coated fabric.

V-type fabric sealing rings mainly consist of support rings, pressure rings, and sealing rings. Unlike [rubber shock absorbing blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and other products, these sealing rings can be stacked according to pressure requirements, saving considerable space. They are suitable for harsh operating conditions, provide good sealing performance, and can also be used for circumferential sealing. They resist impact pressure and allow larger extrusion gaps.

They primarily use nitrile rubber and cotton fabric, and can be used in these media: hydraulic oil, water, and emulsions.
