The main materials for manufacturing [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) include nitrile fabric rubber, fluorine fabric rubber, rubber-plastic fabric rubber, polytetrafluoroethylene, [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/), etc. What appears to be a simple ring actually has significant functions. It offers long service life and strong extrusion resistance, and can work even under harsh conditions with poor surface quality while remaining non-contaminating to the medium. V-type fabric sealing rings are widely used for sealing pistons and piston rods in ultra-high pressure hydraulic cylinders with reciprocating motion. They are suitable for hydraulic cylinders in metallurgy, mining, and general equipment.

Shanghai Shangmai Rubber Factory's high-tech personnel have rich experience in manufacturing [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/). The factory uses advanced manufacturing equipment, and the rubber series products produced have received praise from many customers.
