What are the stress-strain properties of [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/)? The stress-strain curve is a typical curve for elongated crystalline rubber, with its main component being the entropy change caused by the system becoming ordered.

As V-type sealing ring molecules are gradually straightened, the isolating effect of side chains on the molecular chain disappears, and intermolecular attractive forces become significant, thus helping V-type sealing rings resist further deformation. Therefore, V-type sealing rings exhibit high tensile strength when fully stretched. The stress of [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) under constant strain is a function of temperature. As temperature increases, the stress of rubber will increase proportionally. This temperature dependence of V-type sealing ring stress is called the Joule effect, which can explain the fundamental difference between metal elasticity and rubber elasticity.

In V-type sealing rings, each [silicone sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/) is held in a strict lattice by intermolecular forces, so the work done in metal deformation is used to change the intermolecular distances, causing changes in internal energy. Therefore, its elasticity is called "energy elasticity," and its elastic deformation range is much smaller than the "entropy elasticity" change range produced mainly by entropy changes in the system in rubber. Within the general usage range, the stress-strain curve of rubber is non-linear, so the elastic behavior of V-type sealing rings cannot be simply determined by Young's modulus.
