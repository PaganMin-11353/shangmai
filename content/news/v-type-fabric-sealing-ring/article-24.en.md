As rubber products, the working principle of [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) is: unlike products such as [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/), they mainly rely on their own elastic tension to fix on the shaft, and make contact with the shaft surface through the sealing lip with relatively small contact force. They can also compensate for shaft eccentricity, non-coaxiality between the cavity and shaft, and shaft machining errors.

V-type fabric sealing rings can prevent internal grease and oil from leaking outward, while also preventing external dust, dirt, etc. from entering. Since [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) rotate with the working shaft, combined with the effect of centrifugal force, they prevent contaminants from entering the working surface.

Additionally, [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) have advantages such as good mobility and adaptability, with no requirements for installation and machining. Installation and removal are simple and reliable, surface contact pressure is small, therefore friction is low, friction loss and frictional heating are minimal, service life is long, and they provide both sealing and dust-proof functions.
