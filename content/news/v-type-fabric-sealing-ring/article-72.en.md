[V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) are the most complex sealing products to manufacture among all sealing products. Their main materials include nitrile rubber with fabric, fluoroelastomer with fabric, rubber-plastic with fabric, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). They have long service life and can work normally even with poor surface quality, which is something that [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) cannot achieve. They can work in hydraulic oil, water, chemical solutions, and other media without causing contamination to the medium.

The selection is diversified, allowing free mixing and matching to adapt to various current demands for V-type fabric sealing rings. The model specifications are also diversified, meeting the requirements of various machine components with standardized dimensions, which has gained recognition from international consumers.

[V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) are mainly used in mining and ultra-high pressure hydraulic cylinders as the ideal freely combinable sealing components for reciprocating motion between pistons and piston rods. They are also widely used in special oil seals for metallurgical equipment, as well as PTFE oil seals and water seals.
