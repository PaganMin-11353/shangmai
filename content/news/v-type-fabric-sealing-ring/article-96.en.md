With the expansion of production scale, the sealing industry has developed a complete set of solutions in design, manufacturing, and sales. [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) have professional technical teams for developing and producing the latest sealing products, along with sophisticated production design and testing equipment. [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/) have absorbed advanced domestic and international management technologies and experiences over the years, and are gradually innovating and developing. With the development of the times and changes in market demand, they continue to improve, and V-type fabric sealing rings come in many varieties.

Because [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) are particular about material selection: general-purpose type (containing methyl and vinyl), high and low temperature type (containing phenyl, methyl and vinyl), low compression permanent deformation (containing methyl and vinyl), low shrinkage (devolatilized) and solvent resistant (fluorosilicone rubber), etc.

These materials all have excellent high-temperature resistance and sealing performance, with surprisingly good elasticity, widely used in electromechanical, aviation, automotive, and medical industries.
