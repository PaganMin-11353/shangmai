The most fundamental difference between plastic products and [V-type fabric sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/) and other rubber products lies in that plastic undergoes plastic deformation when deformed during manufacturing, while rubber products like [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/) undergo elastic deformation. In other words, plastic is difficult to restore to its original state after deformation, while rubber is relatively much easier.

Plastic has very small elasticity, usually less than 100%, while rubber products like [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) can reach 1000% or even more. For plastic products, the vast majority complete the product process when the molding process is finished; while for rubber products, vulcanization process is still needed after the molding process is completed.

Plastic and V-type fabric sealing ring rubber products both belong to polymer materials, mainly composed of carbon and hydrogen atoms, with some containing small amounts of oxygen, nitrogen, chlorine, silicon, fluorine, sulfur and other atoms, with special properties and special uses. At room temperature, plastic is solid, very hard, and cannot be stretched and deformed. While rubber has low hardness, is elastic, can be stretched and elongated, and can return to its original state when stretching stops. This is caused by the different molecular structures of V-type fabric sealing ring rubber products. Another difference is that plastic can be recycled and reused multiple times, while V-type fabric sealing ring rubber products cannot be directly recycled and used, but can only be processed into reclaimed rubber before use.
