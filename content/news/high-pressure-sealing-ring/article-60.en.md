There are many types of sealing rings, such as: [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), O-ring sealing rings, high-pressure sealing rings, etc. Here we focus on introducing [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) because they have relatively wide applications in real life. According to their structure and usage characteristics, they can be divided into three major categories:

1. Pressurized type: This type of sealing ring is based on the basic type, with a certain amount of gas charged into the tube interior. Under high temperature, the gas expands and increases the tube elasticity to ensure the sealing effect of the sealing ring at high temperatures.

2. Basic type: Made from hollow metal tubes, this belongs to general [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/).

3. Balanced type: Based on the basic type, during operation, through medium pressure, the pressure inside and outside the tube is balanced, thereby increasing the hollow sealing ring's ability to withstand greater working pressure.
