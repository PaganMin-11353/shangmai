I remember that in 2009, a senior engineer from Shanghai Shangmai Rubber Factory introduced the complete molding process of [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/). Here is a review of the general analysis:

The production process of rubber products such as high-pressure sealing rings, [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) is primarily a compression molding process. The general steps are as follows: First, the raw rubber compound is cut into simple shapes, then placed into heated molds where it gradually forms while undergoing vulcanization. Many molded rubber products are manufactured using this compression molding method.

Key Points: 1. To significantly improve the performance and molding time of compression molded rubber products, heat treatment must be performed before molding. 2. During the process of adding rubber into the mold, closing the mold, and degassing, the temperature must be kept constant before demolding.
