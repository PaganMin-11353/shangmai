Sealing rings use a U-shaped outer shell and a V-shaped corrosion spring to form a single-acting seal. The pressure range of [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) is also relatively wide, from vacuum to zero pressure and ultra-high pressure, all capable of ensuring reliable sealing effects. [Silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) can both perform reciprocating and rotational motion, can adapt to most fluids and chemicals, have low friction coefficients and are precise, have strong anti-corrosion capabilities, and excellent dimensional stability.

High and low pressure resistance performance is quite good, capable of withstanding rapid temperature changes. High-pressure sealing rings are widely used in various industries and have received good responses in food and medical hygiene sectors. First, they do not affect food quality and safety in the food industry, and second, they can be sterilized, which is convenient and economical.

[High-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) have unlimited storage life and use high-elasticity materials such as spring stainless steel, with particularly good stability performance.
