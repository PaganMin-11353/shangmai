As products in the [high-pressure sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) category, there are also [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), and other rubber products. With the continuous development of the rubber products industry in recent years, the variety of rubber products has increased, and production and sales volumes have continued to expand, promoting the design and manufacturing of rubber molds from traditional experience-based design to theoretical calculation design.

Especially with the continuous improvement of rubber production equipment such as [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) and the continuous refinement of production processes, rubber molds have become increasingly numerous, and the manufacturing level and complexity of high-pressure sealing ring molds have also become increasingly high. High efficiency, automation, precision, and long service life have become the development trends of rubber molds.

High-pressure sealing ring rubber compression molded products, also known as ordinary compression molding, use semi-finished rubber materials that have been mixed and pre-formed into certain shapes, then weighed and placed into designed molds, which are then placed in plate vulcanizing machines for heating and pressurizing. The rubber materials are vulcanized and formed under pressure and heat. The characteristics of rubber compression molded products like high-pressure sealing rings are simple mold structures, strong versatility, wide application range, and convenient operation, so they occupy a relatively high proportion in rubber products.
