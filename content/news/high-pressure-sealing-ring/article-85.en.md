There are many materials for manufacturing sealing rings, which can be produced according to the functions and applications of various sealing rings. [High-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) are mainly used in high-temperature and high-pressure situations, so the material selection requirements for such sealing rings are also relatively high. Synthetic rubber is more reliable, and with the addition of polytetrafluoroethylene, the heat resistance and pressure resistance capabilities are also relatively strong, with appropriate mechanical strength including expansion strength, elongation, and tear resistance.

[Silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) have the same processing requirements. High-pressure sealing rings are elastic and resilient, do not corrode contact surfaces, have relatively stable performance, are not easily swollen in media, have relatively small thermal shrinkage performance, and do not contaminate the media.

They have relatively wide applications in certain situations, mainly used in aviation, military, and medical industries.
