The sealing performance of sealing rings is also quite good. The difference from sealing strips is only in shape - one is ring-shaped, the other is strip-shaped. [High-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) can be installed according to different mechanical interfaces. [Silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) can also serve as representatives. In fact, the functions of sealing components are similar - they all maximize displacement compensation, which is beneficial for products with some manufacturing defects, saving resources while opening new product markets.

High-pressure sealing rings have smooth surfaces and can serve as oil-free lubricated seals with good wear resistance. Even if the sealing surface is worn, they have automatic compensation capability, mainly utilizing their low friction resistance where static and dynamic friction forces are equal.

Sealing rings can be used in hydraulic oil, emulsion, water-ethylene glycol, acids, alkalis, chemicals, and other media, with relatively long working life. [High-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) are also convenient to install and have simple structures.
