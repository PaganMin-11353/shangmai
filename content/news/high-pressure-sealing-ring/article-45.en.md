Rubber products have high sealing properties, so they can be used to manufacture hydraulic sealing components, such as: [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), and so on. According to model classification, they can also be divided into: O-ring gaskets, V-type combination sealing rings, Y-type sealing rings, J-type sealing rings...

Today there is a type called [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/). This type of sealing ring is oil-resistant, heat-resistant, high-temperature resistant, and acid-alkali resistant, made from a new type of high molecular material combination. Widely used in automotive, power, machinery, hydraulic pneumatic and other various types of mechanical equipment, high-pressure sealing rings mainly use long-lasting polyurethane as raw material, which ensures the flexibility and low deformation value of the sealing ring, allowing the sealing ring to be unaffected by pressure fluctuations during extension.

[High-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) have good sealing performance and can not only prevent contaminants from entering the oil cylinder but also provide dual sealing effects.
