In recent years, with the rapid development of the automotive industry, it has brought new opportunities and challenges to automotive rubber product manufacturers, such as the widespread application of products like [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/).

Automotive rubber products mainly include brake hoses, fuel hoses, [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/), radiator hoses, power steering hoses, [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), turbocharger hoses, air conditioning hoses, and various other hoses with different performance characteristics. For air conditioning hoses, the inner rubber layer generally uses a combination of resin and chlorinated butyl rubber or EPDM rubber, which provides good performance.

Turbocharger hoses primarily require excellent heat resistance, so the inner rubber layer consists of fluoroelastomer and heat-resistant silicone rubber. High-pressure sealing rings use high-strength aramid fiber knitting for the reinforcement layer, and silicone rubber for the outer rubber layer. The inner rubber layer of power steering hoses should have good oil resistance, while the outer rubber layer should have wear resistance, heat resistance, and weather resistance characteristics. Currently, the inner and outer layers of [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) have shifted from nitrile rubber and chloroprene rubber to hydrogenated nitrile rubber, chlorosulfonated polyethylene rubber, chlorinated polyethylene rubber, and acrylic rubber, with nylon 66 as the main reinforcement layer.
