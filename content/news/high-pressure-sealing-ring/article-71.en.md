Sealing rings are also a type of sealing product with diverse styles and a wide range of materials to choose from, including: [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/), [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), O-ring sealing rings, etc. The main characteristic of high-pressure sealing rings is good sealing performance, capable of withstanding tremendous pressure at high temperatures. Often, just one sealing component can complete the sealing of an object, which is both simple and convenient, with low friction resistance, and can freely alternate between high and low pressure conditions.

Some [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) can be used in multiple overlapping rings, are impact pressure resistant, and can release maximum sealing effect through pressure precision. This is an effect that many sealing products cannot achieve. Good sealing performance can achieve almost no leakage during static sealing, with diverse styles and many color options.

Currently, these sealing rings are mainly used in pressure cookers, oil pumps, and medical equipment.
