There are many rubber products available today. Many manufacturers add toxic substances to processing aids to reduce production costs. Since pressure cookers are used for cooking food, the [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) used must be safe and hygienic. Currently, domestic pressure cooker high-pressure sealing rings are mainly made of silicone rubber and nitrile rubber, which are also auxiliary materials for producing [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [rubber shock absorbers](http://www.smpolymer.com/).

For pressure cooker maintenance, it mainly involves the maintenance of five safety components: lid, hole, valve, ring, and plate. When aging is found in these components, they should be replaced promptly.

When selecting [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/), try to purchase newly manufactured products. For newly purchased pressure cookers, pay attention to cleaning the sealing rings. Ensure safe and reliable use.
