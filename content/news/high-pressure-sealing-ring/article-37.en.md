Sealing rings are divided into several categories. According to chemical resistance and versatility, they can be classified into: rubber sealing rings and [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/). These two types of sealing rings have excellent corrosion resistance to acids, alkalis, salts, etc., except for some fluorides and molten alkali metals that can react with them.

According to the materials used to manufacture sealing rings, they can be classified into: natural sealing rings and polyurethane rubber sealing rings. They all have similar properties, with good wear resistance and high pressure resistance superior to other rubber products. [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) are generally suitable for automotive manufacturing.

[High-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) are also a type of sealing ring, generally used in automotive manufacturing. They can prevent contaminants such as mineral powder, mud, and rainwater from entering the oil cylinder from the outside. The greatest effect of sealing rings is excellent sealing performance, preventing leakage and environmental contamination.
