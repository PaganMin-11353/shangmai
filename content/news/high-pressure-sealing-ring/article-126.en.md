The general construction of sealing rings is similar, with the main difference being the materials used. The manufacturing process of [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) is the simplest, and their quality depends on the temperature during molding and time control. High-pressure sealing rings are a type of multiple sealing ring assembly mainly used for sealing piston rods; Pressure: ≤40MPa, Speed: ≤0.5m/s, Temperature: -30°C to +150°C (+200°C) (depending on material).

This [sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/) assembly is used for robust and durable applications. Industrial machinery, industrial equipment, mining and metallurgical equipment, steel industry, automotive industry, construction machinery industry, hydraulic cylinder manufacturers, and other industries' sealing products. • Can work under harsh conditions • Not sensitive to medium contamination • Long service life • Can be optimally adjusted and combined to suit various applications • Can work effectively for a certain time even with poor surface quality • Strong anti-extrusion capability • Suitable for applications with rapid pressure changes • When usage scenarios and structures change, consider changes in leakage performance and friction performance.
