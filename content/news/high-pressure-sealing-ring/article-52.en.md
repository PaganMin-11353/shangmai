This series of sealing rings are all made from rubber as raw material. Most of them are used for waterproofing, oil resistance, and leak prevention. [High-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) are mainly used for sealing gas containers and similar applications. Similar [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) are generally installed in grooves with rectangular cross-sections on the outer or inner circumference, and this type of sealing ring mainly serves a sealing function. High-pressure sealing rings generally use EPDM as raw material, with smooth and fine surfaces, good resilience, uniform foaming, excellent waterproof performance, ozone resistance, aging resistance, and good solvent resistance.

Since [high-pressure sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/gaoyamifengquan/) differ from traditional rubber products, they are convenient to store, simple and quick to install, reduce labor intensity, accelerate project progress, and can lower construction costs.

Sealing rings also require aesthetic consideration, mainly considering their wide range of applications, and attention should be paid to matching effects in decoration.
