In a certain sense, [rubber flexible joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaoruanjietou/) can also be called [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/) or [flexible rubber joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/kequnaoxiangjiaojietou/). What are their thermal characteristics? One of the thermal properties of rubber flexible joints is thermal conductivity: Rubber flexible joints are poor thermal conductors, with a thermal conductivity coefficient of approximately 2.2-6.28 W/m²·K when the thickness is 25 millimeters. They are excellent insulating materials. If rubber is made into microporous or sponge-like form, its insulating effect will be further improved, reducing the thermal conductivity coefficient to 0.4-2.0 W. Any rubber component may generate heat due to hysteresis losses during use, so attention should be paid to heat dissipation. Thermal expansion of rubber flexible joints: Due to the large free volume between molecular chains in rubber flexible joints, when temperature increases, the internal rotation of chain segments becomes easier, causing volume expansion. The linear expansion coefficient of rubber is approximately 20 times that of steel. This must be considered in the vulcanization mold design of rubber products, as the linear dimensions of finished rubber products will be 1.2-3.5% smaller than the mold. For the same [rubber damping block](http://www.smpolymer.com/), the hardness and raw rubber content of the compound also have significant effects on the shrinkage rate. The shrinkage rate is inversely proportional to hardness and directly proportional to rubber content. The theoretical order of shrinkage rates for various rubbers is: Fluorocarbon rubber > Silicone rubber > Butyl rubber > Nitrile rubber > Chloroprene rubber > Styrene-butadiene rubber > Natural rubber. When rubber flexible joint products are used at low temperatures, special attention should be paid to the effects of volume shrinkage. For example, oil seals may leak due to shrinkage, and rubber-metal bonded products may suffer early damage due to excessive stress caused by shrinkage.
