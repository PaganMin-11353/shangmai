The [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/), [flexible rubber joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/kequnaoxiangjiaojietou/), and [rubber flexible joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaoruanjietou/) discussed in this article are essentially the same product, just with different naming conventions.

Rubber flexible joints differ from previously mentioned [silicone gaskets](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and other sealing products - they are even more advanced. They are composed of fabric as reinforcing rubber components, combined with flat unions and metal flanges to form a complete unit. Their application range is primarily in pipeline connections and noise reduction. Additionally, they are rubber products with excellent resistance properties.

In terms of radial characteristics, they can be classified into concentric and eccentric types, as well as straight joints and bent joints. The spherical body can be distinguished as single-ball and double-ball types. The working pressure range is generally between 0.25MPa-2.5MPa.

Good performance and compact size are their most advantageous characteristics, making them increasingly the preferred connecting components in many industries.
