The most widely used sealing ring in hydraulic and pneumatic transmission systems is the O-type sealing ring. Unlike V-type composite sealing rings, O-type sealing rings are widely applied in mechanical components due to their relatively low cost and convenient usage.

Previously, we also mentioned the [Performance Function Comparison Between V-Type and O-Type Sealing Rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/156/). We learned that O-type sealing rings come in many sizes and specifications, making their application range very broad. For different fixed sealing or sealing application scenarios, O-type sealing rings are the most effective and very economical bidirectional sealing elements. Their effectiveness increases with system pressure.
