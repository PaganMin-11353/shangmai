What is the weight of flexible rubber joints? Based on our past experience, among the performance characteristics of flexible rubber joints, the most outstanding feature is their small volume and relatively light weight, making both installation and maintenance very convenient.

In addition to this, other performance features of flexible rubber joints include: excellent elasticity, not being affected or limited by pipeline and flange factors during installation, and having good noise reduction effects during operation. Furthermore, it must be mentioned that similar to other rubber products such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), rubber shock absorber blocks, and [V-type combination sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/130/), although rubber joints are lightweight, their vibration absorption capability is extremely strong.
