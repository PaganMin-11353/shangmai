In the related articles from Shanghai Shangmai [Rubber Factory](http://www.smpolymer.com/), we previously introduced the [weight of flexible rubber joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/133/), so what are their functions and applications? First, let us understand flexible rubber joints! In the industry, rubber joints are often an abbreviation for flexible rubber joints, which have wide applications and applicability, playing important roles in various basic engineering projects.

As a joint with good elasticity and high airtightness, flexible rubber joints are composed of rubber components, metal flanges, etc., used for vibration isolation, noise reduction, and displacement compensation. They have excellent comprehensive performance characteristics, and the media used include joints such as the previously introduced [oil-resistant rubber products](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/136/).
