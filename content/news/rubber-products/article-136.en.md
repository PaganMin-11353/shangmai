Generally speaking, oil-resistant rubber often refers to fluorine rubber that resists non-polar oils, which is classified relative to oil resistance into polar rubber with oil resistance and non-polar rubber without oil resistance. So, different from rubber products such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), V-type sealing rings, rubber shock absorber blocks, what characteristics does this type of rubber product actually have?
