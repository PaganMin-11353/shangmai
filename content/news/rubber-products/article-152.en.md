Through previous knowledge explanations about [advantages of V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/150/) and [selection of V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/151/), you should have some understanding of this type of sealing ring. So, this time we want to discuss the main differences between V-type sealing rings and O-type sealing rings. Of course, literally speaking, these two types of sealing rings differ by only one letter - "V" and "O". Besides this, what other differences are there?

First point: In terms of application, V-type sealing rings and O-type sealing rings are different. If both types of sealing rings are made of silicone material, they are definitely much better than ordinary rubber materials.

Second point: One is an O-type ring, the other is a V-type ring. There are many classifications in terms of materials, with quite a few subdivisions.

Besides the above two points, we need to know that whether V-type sealing rings or O-type sealing rings, these can all be stacked for use! It's just that O-type sealing rings are used in stacked configurations more frequently. For V-type sealing rings, there's a pressure cover, a support ring, and V-shaped ring elements in the middle.
