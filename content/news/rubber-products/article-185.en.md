With the increase in brake fluid working environment temperature and the use of high boiling point brake fluids, EPDM rubber or butyl rubber has gradually replaced styrene-butadiene rubber as the main material for automotive brake hoses.

Because brake hoses are related to vehicle safety and personal safety, the requirements for brake hoses during production are very strict. High-quality brake hoses must not only have brake fluid resistance characteristics but also possess aging resistance and moisture penetration resistance.

Current brake rubber hoses mainly include inner rubber layer and outer rubber layer. The main material of these two layers is EPDM rubber. Between these two layers, there is also a middle rubber layer composed of natural rubber, belonging to two-layer braided reinforcement layers.
