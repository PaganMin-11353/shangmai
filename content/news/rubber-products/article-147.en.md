As we know, rubber expansion joints with guide tubes are equipped with guide tubes added to ordinary rubber expansion joints. The process and materials used for the guide tubes make the rubber expansion joints more wear-resistant and corrosion-resistant.

So, what materials are these rubber expansion joints made of, which differ from [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), silicone sealing rings, rectangular non-metallic expansion joints and other [rubber products](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/)? The guide tubes are made of 3mm PTFE, or manufactured from 316L stainless steel and other commonly known wear-resistant materials.

In actual operation, sealing rings are often added to the end positions of the guide tubes as sealing protection, making these rubber expansion joints with guide tubes work more smoothly and efficiently.
