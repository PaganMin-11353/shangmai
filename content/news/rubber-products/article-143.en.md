Currently, the rubber industry is increasingly penetrating into various industry sectors, especially in industrial, aerospace, petroleum, automotive and other industries, where there is an extreme demand for rubber products, and the performance indicators for rubber products are becoming increasingly strict and diversified. Such as: low-temperature resistance, oil resistance, and solvent resistance are all typical industry requirements.

Facing this kind of demand for low-temperature resistant rubber products, the development direction of the industry is very clear, which is to conduct technological innovation, test more rubber formulations, and meet more diverse industry performance requirements.

Among rubber products, as Shangmai Company, a [Shanghai rubber factory](http://www.smpolymer.com/), based on experience, customers' regular demands include: tensile resistance, wear resistance, tear strength performance, as well as requirements for high and low temperature rubber product endurance. In terms of temperature resistance, even under certain low-temperature or high-temperature conditions, the manufactured rubber products must maintain good elasticity and stability.
