In broad terms, rubber can generally be divided into two types: natural rubber and synthetic rubber. Among these, natural rubber can be further subdivided into: 1. General-purpose rubber, 2. Specialty rubber. If we want to subdivide further, general-purpose rubber and specialty rubber can be respectively subdivided into the following common types:

First, classification of general-purpose rubber: can be divided into styrene-butadiene rubber, polybutadiene rubber, polyisoprene rubber, as well as ethylene-propylene rubber, chloroprene rubber and other rubber categories.

Second, classification of specialty rubber: can be divided into nitrile rubber, chloroprene rubber, chlorinated rubber, fluorine rubber, as well as chloro-ether rubber, silicone rubber, polyurethane rubber, polysulfide rubber, acrylate rubber and other rubber categories.

In addition, rubber also has numerous process characteristics, among which the most obvious and prominent typical ones are: high elasticity and low-temperature resistance. Proper vulcanization of rubber can maintain maximum utilization of its high elasticity, while also maintaining rubber hardness without damage and enhancing wear resistance.

The above is the classification of rubber and analysis of its process characteristics elucidated by [Shanghai Rubber Factory](http://www.smpolymer.com/), combined with the previously discussed [basic properties of rubber](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/149/), which can help everyone better understand some basic knowledge about rubber.
