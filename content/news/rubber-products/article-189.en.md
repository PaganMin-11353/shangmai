With continuous innovation in technology and science, the materials and technologies used in automotive fuel rubber hoses are also constantly being updated and replaced. The rubber materials used in fuel rubber hoses have also undergone continuous innovation and improvement to increase their service life.

For example, by adopting winding methods to strengthen skeletal materials, using continuous vulcanization methods instead of intermittent vulcanization methods, and eliminating reinforcing fiber threads through fiber-reinforced rubber, the tensile strength of fuel hoses has been increased, and the hardness and service life of fuel hoses have been enhanced.

In the future, we will continue to improve fuel rubber hoses in terms of environmental protection, energy saving, safety, and economy through technological innovation.
