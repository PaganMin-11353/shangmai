Desulfurization non-metallic expansion joints are elastic compensation elements with telescopic functions. They have low production costs, wide application scope, and these expansion joints feature very compact structures. They have extensive applications in many industrial fields, such as: chemical, mechanical, and metallurgical industries where desulfurization non-metallic expansion joints can be found. Their main functions include: dust prevention, shock absorption and misalignment prevention, good sealing performance, and many other technical properties.

The main application area for desulfurization non-metallic expansion joints is in flue gas duct connections, especially in power plant boiler flue gas systems, where they are reliable components ensuring safe and stable operation of such systems.

According to research personnel from Shanghai Shangmai [Rubber Factory](http://www.smpolymer.com/), desulfurization non-metallic expansion joints have the following standards: standard half-height expansion joints (wave height h=108mm) and standard full-height expansion joints (wave height h=216mm). These two standard types can be selected based on actual applications, and can be various combinations of single-wave and double-wave joints to form multi-wave non-metallic expansion joints.
