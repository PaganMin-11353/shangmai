As a circular-shaped sealing ring similar to an "O-type," we usually call it an "O-type sealing ring." This sealing ring is a very common sealing component product, characterized by excellent sealing performance, convenient disassembly, and low friction resistance.

From the perspective of mechanical operating principles, O-type sealing rings can be used not only in static sealing environments but also in dynamic sealing environments, such as reciprocating motion. Its application range is also very broad, capable of meeting various conditions' requirements for sealing performance.

In various types of mechanical equipment, O-type sealing rings can often be seen. Their oil resistance, temperature resistance, and pressure resistance performance are all extremely outstanding. Whether on ships, aerospace, or engineering, construction, petroleum, mining and other mechanical instruments, there is extensive use of sealing components like [V-type combination sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/130/), O-type sealing rings, and [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/).

As a [Shanghai rubber factory](http://www.smpolymer.com/) capable of customizing rubber products for various harsh working conditions, Shanghai Shangmai Polymer Materials Co., Ltd. will also serve the sealing needs of all industries with more complete facilities, newer equipment, and better processes and formulations!
