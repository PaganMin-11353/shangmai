Recently, Shanghai Shangmai Rubber Factory has made standardized adjustments to the process and production line of V-type fabric-reinforced rubber composite sealing rings, making them more optimized and high-standard. Therefore, it is necessary to introduce the standard structure of V-type fabric-reinforced rubber composite sealing rings here.

V-type fabric-reinforced rubber composite sealing rings, as a subdivision product of [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), are a set of seals composed of fiber-reinforced chevron rings. The typical structure is: 1+5+1, or another structure is: 1+3+1. This type of sealing ring has a very obvious characteristic: high compression. In reciprocating motion, it is suitable for compression-type sealing between pistons and piston rods of ultra-high pressure cylinders.

In addition, V-type fabric-reinforced rubber composite sealing rings consist of three parts: support ring (supporting V-type sealing ring), V-type sealing ring, and pressure ring (ensuring uniform pressure distribution). Here we know that [V-type sealing rings have many advantages](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/150/). If combined with sealing rings made of pure rubber, the sealing performance and effectiveness will be very good.
