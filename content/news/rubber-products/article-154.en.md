Commonly used sealing rings have many models, such as [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), silicone sealing rings, and O-type sealing rings, which are just part of the sealing ring types. So what models of sealing rings are there exactly, and what are their functions?

If we classify sealing rings by their properties, they can be divided into: high temperature resistant, high pressure resistant, corrosion resistant, and wear resistant (with automatic elastic compensation function) sealing rings. Their main functions are for oil-proof and water-proof applications, as well as preventing gas leakage and anti-corrosion functions.

In terms of material technology, they are generally manufactured using nitrile rubber, natural rubber, fluorine rubber, silicone rubber, etc. Their shapes also vary, including O-type sealing rings, as well as V-type, D-type, T-type, X-type and other shapes.

Sealing rings have simple structure and convenient installation, and their working pressure range is also very large. Therefore, they are quite common in industrial and other field applications.
