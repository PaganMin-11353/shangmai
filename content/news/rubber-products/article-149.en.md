Rubber, as we know it, along with plastics and fibers, is called one of the three major synthetic materials. Its greatest characteristic is having various resistance functions, such as: air permeability resistance, temperature resistance, corrosion resistance, etc. Moreover, the synthetic effects of rubber should not be underestimated, as it can often be blended, compounded, and combined with various materials, with particularly prominent features in both performance and durability.

Just as we mentioned before with [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and other rubber shock-absorbing products, their shock absorption function is also very outstanding, whether in automotive industry applications or locomotive applications, they are quite extensive and effective.

In sealing applications, the [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and silicone sealing rings we know also demonstrate that rubber, as a special comprehensive entity of physical structural characteristics and chemical properties, can provide sealing and insulation functions. It can be said that it is precisely because of rubber material's excellent structural performance that the expression of various mechanical and other properties becomes more outstanding and smooth.
