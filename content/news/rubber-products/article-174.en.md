The main principle of V-type combined seal ring installation is to ensure sealing of double-sided oil inlet pistons in hydraulic cylinders. This sealing mechanism, in free state, has a self-sealing effect. By increasing contact stress and changing the contact state, it promotes closer connection between the lip and the hole. Additionally, from the article [Industrial Application Analysis of V-Type Fabric-Reinforced Seal Rings and Silicone Seal Rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/170/), we clearly understand that if pressure is further reduced, internal pressure disappears, thus achieving a sealing effect that prevents gas or liquid leakage and provides excellent sealing performance.
