Silicone sealing rings, as the name suggests, are sealing rings with silicone as the main material. Since silicone is a type of rubber, silicone sealing rings have many advantages. Compared to [V-type fabric-reinforced sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), they also have different advantages and disadvantages. The distinction between the advantages and disadvantages of silicone sealing rings and V-type fabric-reinforced sealing rings can actually be approached from the following three aspects:

1. First, due to its natural rubber properties, silicone sealing rings are very environmentally friendly, with no odor, no toxins, and no harmful substances produced, causing no harm to the human body.

2. Additionally, silicone sealing rings are not only high-temperature resistant but also low-temperature resistant, capable of use in temperatures from -60°C to 200°C while still maintaining good elasticity.

3. Furthermore, referring to the previously mentioned [Overview of V-Type Fabric-Reinforced Sealing Rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/vxingjiabumifengquan/89/), we can understand that silicone sealing rings have good tensile properties. They will not deform in harsh weather or extreme heat, and even after decades of use, they can still maintain good elasticity and tensile strength.
