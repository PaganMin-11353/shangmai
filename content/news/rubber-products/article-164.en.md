Non-metallic expansion joints composed of fiber fabric, rubber, and high-temperature resistant materials, also known as fabric compensators, are a type of compensator. Their main function is to compensate for vibrations from fans, air ducts during operation, and pipe deformation. High-temperature resistant non-metallic expansion joints have different performance and characteristics compared to [V-type fabric-reinforced sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/).
