Through our previous article on [advantages of V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/150/), we already have a general understanding of the advantages and standard forms of V-type sealing rings. So, when selecting V-type sealing rings, how should we achieve reasonable selection? As selection principles for V-type sealing rings, the following points need attention:

1. Need to pay attention to the pressure and characteristics of V-type sealing rings, including V-type rubber sealing rings and fabric-reinforced sealing rings.

2. Need to pay attention to the pressure and characteristics of sealing rings. Different pressures produce different extrusion of V-type sealing rings, so this should be noted.

3. The rotational speed of V-type rings is closely related to cooling and lubrication. At this time, attention should be paid to the range values of reciprocating motion speed, especially under high-speed and high-pressure conditions.

4. In addition to the above three points, engineers from [Shanghai Rubber Factory](http://www.smpolymer.com/) believe that characteristic values such as friction coefficient, wear resistance, and impact resistance should also be considered.
