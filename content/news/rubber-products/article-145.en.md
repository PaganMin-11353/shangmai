In the flue gas desulfurization implementation process, our design and selection of [desulfurization non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/132/) is particularly critical. It requires that expansion joints be able to absorb vibrations and maximum deformations occurring in three dimensions during the operation of flue gas desulfurization systems, to prevent incorrectly transmitting forces to adjacent equipment and components, causing irreparable structural and functional damage.

In the actual implementation process, [Shanghai rubber factory](http://www.smpolymer.com/) based on the expansion joints' inherent working principle, namely: able to expand and contract freely without tearing or leaking, selected temperature-resistant, pressure-resistant, and corrosion-resistant materials for preventive treatment. By arranging expansion joints that can absorb thermal deformation and vibration in appropriate positions, very good results were achieved.

During the operation of expansion joints in flue gas desulfurization, we also made prevention and improvements for damage and failure of expansion joints, completely avoiding damage caused by powder accumulation in expansion joint cavities, as well as damage and failure of expansion joints caused by temperature and corrosion.

In the entire design process, only by being familiar with the main processes of flue gas desulfurization technology can we correctly select and design non-metallic expansion joints, ensuring that the entire desulfurization system can operate safely, stably, and efficiently.
