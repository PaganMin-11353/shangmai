Sometimes, during vehicle use, oil leakage often occurs. Why does lubricating oil still leak even when oil seals are used for sealing? Poor sealing is the main reason for oil seal leakage. When the shaft where the oil seal is located forms grooves due to wear, oil leakage problems will occur even with new oil seals. The main reason is that the contact pressure between the oil seal lip and the shaft decreases, causing the oil seal lip diameter to not match the shaft neck.

The fundamental reason lies in the quality issues of V-type seal rings, oil seals and other rubber products. Poor quality oil seals or bearings will cause decreased contact pressure between the oil seal lip and bearing. Additionally, improper use, installation, or maintenance can also cause oil seal leakage.
