All components where liquid lubricating oil connects with external parts require oil seals. Therefore, the importance of oil seals is evident. Oil seals have extremely simple designs and very simple processing technology, requiring only one compression molding process with low cost. Oil seals have very small volume, light weight, and minimal material requirements.

Additionally, during installation, oil seals do not occupy much space and can be easily processed, making machines more compact. For more information on rubber materials, see: [Brief Description of Rubber Materials Used for Oil Seals and Various Silicone and V-Type Seal Rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/181/)

Furthermore, the greatest function and advantage of oil seals is their sealing performance. As long as the installation dimensions are appropriate, oil seals have excellent sealing performance and will absolutely not cause liquid leakage. Based on rubber characteristics, they have very long service life, low cost, and low wear.
