As [V-type seal rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) have an extremely wide range of applications, their materials are a key focus for both manufacturers and consumers. What are the material and performance specifications of V-type seal rings in 2013? Let's introduce them below!

The main materials of V-type seal rings include nitrile rubber and chloroprene rubber. This is also consistent with our previously published article [Analysis of V-Type Seal Ring Varieties and Production Processes in 2013](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/167/).

Nitrile rubber materials include butadiene and acrylonitrile, which are synthesized through emulsion polymerization. Nitrile rubber has excellent oil resistance, wear resistance, heat resistance, and strong bonding properties. However, it also has disadvantages: nitrile rubber has poor low-temperature resistance and ozone resistance, and its elasticity is not very high.
