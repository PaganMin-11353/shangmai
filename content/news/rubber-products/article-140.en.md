We know that high-temperature resistant non-metallic expansion joints are commonly used in boiler flues, hot air ducts, and smoke and dust ducts. The types of these expansion joints include: straight tube type, compound type, angular type, and rectangular expansion joints.

Previously, we also introduced the related standard specifications of [desulfurization non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/132/). High-temperature resistant non-metallic expansion joints not only have good high-temperature resistance and anti-corrosion performance, but also have excellent sealing properties, complete production and assembly systems, and are lightweight in structure, easy to install and maintain.

In addition, it should be noted that the main materials of high-temperature resistant non-metallic expansion joints include [rubber](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and fiber fabrics that can withstand high temperatures, providing highly efficient compensation for various pipeline deformations and vibrations.
