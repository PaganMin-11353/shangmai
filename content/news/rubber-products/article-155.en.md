The [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) we commonly know have many main applications, suitable for preservation and insulation industries, such as related products including: fresh-keeping boxes, insulation boxes, thermal boxes, etc. Besides this, in our daily life we can often see many daily items that require water sealing, and among these, the sealing function provided by silicone sealing rings is certainly not to be underestimated.

Previously, we also discussed [introduction to sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/154/). Similarly, silicone sealing rings can maintain effective sealing function for long periods within the temperature range of -60 degrees to 200 degrees, so their application in daily consumer goods is quite broad.

As high-quality silicone sealing rings, [Shanghai Rubber Factory](http://www.smpolymer.com/) believes that we can also understand the common characteristics of this type of sealing ring, for example:

1. Good preservation effect, excellent sealing performance, especially for waterproof sealing applications.

2. High temperature resistance and wear resistance without deformation.

3. No impact on human health. Even when heated under high temperature and intense heat conditions, it will not turn brown or produce substances that affect health.
