As a relatively common silicone raw material, the high-temperature resistant silicone sheets we are discussing in this article are commonly used to make silicone molds. For general silicone sheets, their high-temperature resistance ranges from 200°C to 300°C. For working conditions with maximum temperatures of 400°C, high-temperature resistant silicone sheets have their special performance applications.
