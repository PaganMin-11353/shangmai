The main materials of [silicone seal rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) are precipitated silicone or pure silicone. Precipitated silicone has a hardness between 30-70 degrees and is mainly used for mid to low-grade silicone products. Pure silicone has a hardness between 40-60 degrees, is transparent in color, has strong tensile strength, and therefore has higher costs, mainly used for high-grade silicone products such as silicone tubes.

Therefore, it is necessary for us to provide the following comprehensive review of silicone with O-type and [V-type seal rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), as shown below:

From a physical properties perspective, the raw materials of silicone seal rings can be divided into solid silicone and liquid silicone. Solid silicone is mainly used for solid compression molding products. The phone cases and silicone tubes we commonly use belong to solid silicone. Liquid silicone, as the name suggests, is liquid silicone with high-temperature resistance characteristics.
