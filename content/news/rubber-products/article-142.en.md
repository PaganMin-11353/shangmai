In the rubber and plastic industry, what we generally call single-sphere rubber expansion joints are simply abbreviated as "rubber joints". In addition to this designation, there are also terms such as: rubber flexible joints, rubber flexible connectors, and the previously introduced [rectangular non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/135/). Its exceptional high performance determines that single-sphere rubber expansion joints have many practical applications in various industrial fields.

As rubber expansion joints, they inherently possess high strength and high stability with cold and heat adaptability. Whether under high pressure, high temperature, strong radiation, harsh geological conditions, or other severe working conditions, single-sphere rubber expansion joints demonstrate excellent working performance.

We at Shangmai, as an analytical [Shanghai rubber factory](http://www.smpolymer.com/), often notice that in Shanghai, this industrially developed city, whether it's raw sewage transportation applications, thermal power plant circulating water applications, or applications in metallurgy, chemical, petrochemical and other related fields, single-sphere rubber expansion joints can demonstrate their excellent comprehensive advantages and highly efficient working performance.
