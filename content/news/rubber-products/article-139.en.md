Speaking of [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), they are very common in the rubber industry and have many applications in industry. As for V-type fabric-clamped sealing rings, what specifications do they have? What are their functions? In terms of performance, both [V-type combination sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/130/) and V-type fabric-clamped sealing rings are products widely trusted by users, extensively applied in fields such as mining equipment and metallurgical industrial equipment.

Fabric-clamped rubber, as a commonly used material for V-type sealing rings, can enhance the hardness and strength of sealing rings. It is often used in high-pressure environments, and even during wear and consumption processes, the actual wear of the sealing surface is quite uniform, with almost no obvious friction changes.

With very extensive applications and numerous advantages, V-type fabric-clamped sealing rings are continuously expanding their user base, and we believe they will become important molded products in the rubber industry in the future.
