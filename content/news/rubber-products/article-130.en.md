The new V-type combination sealing ring consists of several V-shaped rings, one elastic sealing ring, and one retaining ring as an organic combination. The characteristic of this type of [V-type sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/) is: completely combining the above three small parts together, allowing them to be used in an overlapping manner, and as a sealing ring assembly, they cannot be used individually as separate components.

Compared with the old standard V-type fabric-reinforced rubber sealing rings, the biggest characteristic of this V-type combination sealing ring lies in its structure, which enables the elastic sealing ring and V-type ring to simultaneously play a key sealing role. If we examine its structure in depth, we can see that high-pressure oil flows from the outer ring to the inner ring through the top of the sealing ring. At this time, the internal and external stresses are equal, enabling this V-type combination sealing ring's inner and outer lips to maintain a balanced tight compression effect on the surface.

In the design, manufacturing, and improvement process of combination sealing rings, it is necessary to continuously widen the platform to enhance the bearing capacity of the pressure-bearing surface. After reasonably determining the groove type and size, the sealing ring will become more efficient and reliable.
