As an axially acting rubber sealing ring, [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) have very significant advantages. Today we will explain their standard forms. V-type sealing rings can be used for unpressurized shaft sealing environments, where they have outstanding mobility and adaptability.

Previously, we also learned about the relevant structure and technical specifications of [V-type fabric-reinforced sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/148/). As V-type sealing rings with broader application scope, what special advantages do they have?

1. The sealing lip has good mobility and adaptability, suitable for high-speed operation environments.

2. Can prevent internal grease from leaking out or oil spillage, and has dust-proof function.

3. Low design workload, suitable for retrofitting and various repair occasions.

Additionally, V-type sealing rings have the following four standard forms:

1. VA-type design, which is most commonly used.

2. VS-type design, with conical shape.

3. VL-type design, with compact structure.

4. VE-type design, suitable for heavy-duty environments.

The above is a brief explanation of the advantages and standard forms of V-type sealing rings, which have already played considerable auxiliary roles in various industrial applications and related field applications.
