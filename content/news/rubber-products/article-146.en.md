Previously, regarding non-metallic expansion joints, we have mainly introduced [desulfurization non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/132/), as well as [rectangular non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/135/), [high-temperature resistant non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/140/), etc. Today we will discuss dust-proof non-metallic expansion joints, whose structure generally consists of six main parts: membrane, insulation layer, stainless steel wire mesh, frame, baffle plate, and dust bag. So what are the characteristics and functions of these components?

First, the membrane serves as an expansion and contraction element in non-metallic expansion joints, playing a major role and determining the maximum expansion amount to some extent. The membrane is an ultra-high-strength sealing composite material, whose main function is to absorb expansion amounts, with excellent anti-aging, anti-penetration properties, and chemical stability in various environments.

Second, the insulation layer has dual functions: insulation and air tightness. It has good extensibility and tensile strength, preventing the outward loss of insulation materials.

Third, the stainless steel wire mesh plays a reinforcing and protective role in the entire non-metallic expansion joint. Under certain environmental conditions, it can protect the membrane surface from damage, providing good material performance protection.

Fourth, the frame has sufficient strength and toughness, generally made by integral stamping, with fewer welds and a more refined appearance.

Fifth, the baffle plate serves two functions: one is bidirectional flow guidance, and the other is to protect the insulation layer well. During operation, the baffle plate should not affect the displacement of the dust-proof non-metallic expansion joint.

Sixth, the dust bag is primarily for dust prevention, preventing dust accumulation from damaging the membrane and providing flue gas purification.

In actual working environments and implementation processes, [Shanghai Rubber Factory](http://www.smpolymer.com/) recommends that dust-proof non-metallic expansion joints should use expansion joints with high low-temperature and corrosion resistance performance, with stainless steel wire mesh added to the outermost layer for enhanced protection.
