Power steering hoses are composed of inner rubber layers and outer rubber layers. Since power steering hoses are mainly used in automotive power steering pumps, their main contact medium is mineral oil. Especially for the inner rubber layer, it must have very good oil resistance, firmness, and sealing properties. The current main materials for the inner rubber layer are nitrile rubber and chloroprene rubber. Compared to [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), emerging materials such as hydrogenated nitrile rubber are now also beginning to be used.
