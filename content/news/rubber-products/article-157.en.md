Through the previous general introduction to [V-type fabric-reinforced sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/148/), you should have a preliminary understanding of this type of sealing ring. If we go deeper, what is the material of V-type fabric-reinforced sealing rings? How do they function, and what about their performance? Let us explain one by one:

As a branch type of [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), V-type fabric-reinforced sealing rings are mostly made of nitrile rubber, sandwiched with cotton fabric, with a cross-sectional shape in "V" form. They have oil sealing functions and a very wide application range. The thickness is generally 18.5mm, with inner and outer diameters of 14mm and 24mm respectively. They have high-pressure resistance characteristics, with a temperature range often between -35-100 degrees Celsius, and pressure of 40MPa. Below we will discuss the main performance characteristics of V-type fabric-reinforced sealing rings.

According to [Shanghai Rubber Factory](http://www.smpolymer.com/), this type of sealing ring can be used and work under extremely harsh working conditions, with very long service life, and can be used for multiple purposes and applications. Their extrusion resistance performance is strong, making them very suitable for sealing applications in various industrial fields.
