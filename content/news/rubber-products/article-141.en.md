In the field of [rubber products](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/), there are quite extensive practical applications in the automotive parts market. Such as: applications of automotive rubber hoses, applications in automotive shock absorption and protection, as well as applications in sealing, dust prevention, and automotive protective components. Below, we will provide more understanding and introduction of these automotive rubber products:

First, let's talk about rubber hoses, which include classifications such as silicone hoses, high-pressure hoses, low-pressure hoses, metal flexible hoses, as well as radiator hoses and air hoses. These types of rubber products are often the most common.

Regarding automotive shock absorption components, we know that the comfort during vehicle operation often mainly depends on shock absorbers, just like the buffering effect provided by [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/), while handling stability depends on springs. However, these two must ultimately be matched together to improve comfort, which is the key role that automotive shock absorption rubber products play in vehicle comfort.

Automotive rubber components such as sealing and dust prevention, wire harness protection, etc., also have quite a few [rubber product manufacturers](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/138/) in China conducting supporting and research and development, and are widely applied in engineering, mechanical and other fields. Therefore, it can be said that automotive parts rubber products are necessary and have very good development prospects.
