The rubber component in KXT type elastomer rubber expansion joints is fluorine rubber. This type of joint is suitable for application in desulfurization systems of thermal power plants. It has characteristics of resistance to strong acids and alkalis, high temperature resistance (-35°C to 200°C), corrosion resistance, wear resistance, and anti-aging properties. In actual applications in desulfurization systems, it can significantly improve the service life of pipelines. Additionally, due to the numerous advantages of KXT type elastomer rubber expansion joints, they are also applied in petrochemical, metallurgical, industrial boiler and other various systems and fields.
