The structure of V-type fabric-reinforced sealing rings consists of the upper V-shaped ring surface, inner and outer ring surfaces, circular groove, and lower V-shaped ring surface of the sealing ring. As a type of [V-type sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/), this rubber ring has outstanding sealing performance and can greatly improve application performance in various environments requiring high sealing.

Technically speaking, V-type fabric-reinforced sealing rings have strong practicality. Compared with general [rubber products](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/), their high-performance sealing properties and long service life of sealing components not only provide convenience for practical applications in various industries, but also save considerable supporting costs.

As a type of V-type fabric-reinforced sealing ring with great market prospects, we believe that whether now or in the future, it will promote the development of the rubber products industry and the improvement of supporting applications in various related industries.
