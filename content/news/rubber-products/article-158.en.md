From the appearance perspective, [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) have a "V"-shaped cross-section, making them a type of lip sealing ring. The V-type ring is made of pure rubber material, so it has good elasticity, can be easily stretched while also having considerable toughness.

Under certain conditions, the outer diameter of the V-type ring will be larger than the inner diameter of the packing cavity. The support ring in the sealing ring can ensure that deformation occurs only at the lip head position. Through clear understanding of [the structure and technical specifications of V-type fabric-reinforced sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/148/), we know that even under very high pressure, the lip will fit more tightly. All this is due to the natural self-sealing performance of the lip, making sealing very natural.

Due to the relatively simple structure of V-type sealing rings and their extremely convenient use, they are widely applied in various fields such as: industry, metalworking, lathes, water treatment, power plants, etc., due to their high and stable reliability during work processes.
