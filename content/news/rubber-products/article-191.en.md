On April 14, 2016, the Third Shanghai-London Low-Carbon International City Forum successfully concluded in Shanghai Lingang. Today, the concept of low-carbon environmental protection has become deeply rooted in people's hearts. How does [Shangmai Polymer Materials Company](http://www.smpolymer.com/), as an enterprise with a high sense of social responsibility and environmental awareness, contribute to humanity's low-carbon initiatives? The answer is recycled rubber.

Just from the literal meaning, we know that recycled rubber is an environmentally friendly material. Indeed, recycled rubber is a product developed for environmental protection, sustainable development, and low-carbon environmental protection.

The raw materials for recycled rubber are waste materials generated during the production process of general rubber products. By recycling these seemingly useless waste materials that would cause enormous environmental pollution, we not only create useful recycled rubber for daily life but also handle waste and contribute to environmental protection.
