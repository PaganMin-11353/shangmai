There are many types of sealing rings, such as the [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) we want to discuss, as well as O-type sealing rings, U-type sealing rings, rectangular sealing rings, etc. This is just a distinction made based on appearance. If distinguished by material, they can also be categorized as: nitrile rubber, natural rubber, fluorine rubber, silicone rubber sealing rings, etc.

So, what we want to discuss this time is: among them, what are the performance functions of V-type and O-type sealing rings?

First, we need to understand that when distinguishing according to the properties of sealing rings, the functions that sealing rings possess are high temperature resistance, high pressure resistance, corrosion resistance, and wear resistance, etc. Their main functions also lie in waterproofing, oil-proofing, and gas sealing, etc. With this understanding, it's not difficult for us to distinguish the performance and functions of V-type and O-type sealing rings.

Regarding the previously mentioned [advantages of V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/150/), we are all very clear about them. As an axially acting and elastic rubber sealing ring, V-type sealing rings can largely prevent leakage of internal grease and oil, and of course, can also prevent the entry of external substances, providing excellent sealing function.

O-type sealing rings, on the other hand, are used for static sealing and reciprocating motion sealing situations. For sealing during rotational motion, consideration must be given that they are only stable under low-speed conditions.
