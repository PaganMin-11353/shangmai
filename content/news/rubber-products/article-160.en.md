In 2012, Shanghai Rubber Factory discussed the relevant details of [V-type composite sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/130/). Today, we will introduce them again!

The cross-section of V-type composite sealing rings is V-shaped, hence they are called V-type rings. Their applications are also very wide, suitable for various sealing conditions. As composite-type V-type sealing rings, multiple sealing rings can even be combined and installed together for use. Whether under high pressure or low pressure, or hydraulic environmental conditions, whether in hydraulic machinery or under complex working conditions of high-speed long-stroke, the performance of this type of sealing ring is very outstanding. Even under the most adverse conditions, V-type composite sealing rings work excellently due to their robustness and toughness. As shown in the diagram below:

Under various harsh conditions, this type of [V-type sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/) from Shanghai Rubber Factory still has a very long service life. Through optimal combination pairing, they can adapt to applications in various heights and industrial fields, making them a very reliable and stable type of sealing product.
