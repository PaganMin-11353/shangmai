The installation effectiveness of O-ring seals depends on the consistency between the O-ring seal's own dimensions and the groove dimensions. The difference in groove shapes between O-ring seals and [V-type seals](http://www.smpolymer.com/) lies in how different groove shapes correspond to different applications of O-ring seals.

Groove shapes mainly have five types: rectangular grooves, V-type grooves, semicircular grooves, trapezoidal grooves, and triangular grooves.

Therefore, through the relevant introduction of [Applicable Systems and Application Scenarios for O-Type and V-Type Combined Seals](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaozhipin/162/), we can understand that rectangular grooves are suitable for both static sealing and dynamic sealing. V-type grooves are only suitable for static sealing and can easily cause damage in dynamic sealing applications. Semicircular grooves are suitable for rotary sealing. Trapezoidal grooves are generally used less frequently. Triangular grooves are often suitable for static sealing working environments.
