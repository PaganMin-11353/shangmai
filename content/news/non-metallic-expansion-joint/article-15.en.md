In pipeline connections, due to the meticulous nature of workmanship, some errors are inevitable. This is when [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) come in handy to eliminate these installation errors. Similar products like [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) also have compensating effects. The general materials of non-metallic expansion joints are silicone rubber products, which have good high-temperature resistance and corrosion resistance, and can effectively reduce noise and vibration during mechanical construction processes. [Non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) have excellent sealing properties. Shanghai Shangmai Rubber Factory adopts imported technology, and although costs have increased somewhat, considerable time is saved during processing, and their prices are also lower than metallic expansion joints, with service life comparable to imported products.
