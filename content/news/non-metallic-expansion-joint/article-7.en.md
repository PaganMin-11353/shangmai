A rubber material that can compensate for vibrations during fan and duct operation as well as pipeline deformation should be the [non-metallic expansion joint](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/), which, similar to [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), provides sealing functions.

The main components of non-metallic expansion joint construction include: membrane, stainless steel wire mesh, insulation cotton, thermal barrier filler layer, frame, and baffle plate. Membrane: This is a high-strength sealing composite material made from various high-performance silicone rubber materials, providing waterproof and leak-proof functions. Stainless steel wire: Functions to prevent debris from escaping outward, serving as the inner lining of the non-metallic expansion joint. Insulation cotton: Possesses sound absorption and vibration isolation transmission functions with good extensibility and tensile strength. Thermal barrier filler layer: This is an important guarantee for the thermal insulation of [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/), composed of various high-temperature resistant materials. Frame: Has sufficient strength and rigidity, with materials suitable for the temperature of the medium. Baffle plate: Features corrosion resistance and wear resistance with flow guidance and thermal barrier layer protection functions.
