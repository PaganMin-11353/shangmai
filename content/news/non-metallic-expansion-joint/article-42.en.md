In mechanical equipment applications, thermal effects generated by equipment movement cause machines to produce heat. At this time, we need a compensator to absorb this heat. [Non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) are high-quality compensators that absorb this heat, capable of compensating for displacement generated by thermal effects, and can also compensate for axial, lateral, and angular displacement. Even more effective are [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/), which adopt international advanced technology in both design and application.

Current non-metallic expansion joints mostly use the most advanced materials and processes available today. After special anti-corrosion and sealing treatment, they can be fully used in power, metallurgy, and other industrial fields.

Due to the characteristics of [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) such as high temperature resistance, corrosion resistance, and good sealing performance, they are often widely applied to boilers, flue gas and coal powder pipelines, fan inlets and outlets, etc.
