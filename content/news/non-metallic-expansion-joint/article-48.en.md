Compensators are what we call devices that make up for inadequate defects in reality. [Non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) have many advantages, and at the same time [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) also have many advantages. Below, we will focus on introducing the characteristics of non-metallic expansion joints.

First, they can compensate for installation errors. Nothing in the world is perfect, and there will always be some defects. At this time, compensators play the role of making up for these defects.

Second, they can compensate for thermal expansion. Since the machine body generates a lot of heat during operation, using [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) can provide multi-directional compensation, with effects greatly superior to single-type compensators.

They have the function of noise reduction and vibration damping, good high temperature resistance, corrosion resistance, and excellent sealing properties. When applied to boilers, fans, and other equipment, they can reduce noise and vibration.
