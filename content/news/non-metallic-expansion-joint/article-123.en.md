The brittle temperature of [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) is the highest temperature at which a test specimen suffers damage under impact under certain conditions. It is a quality indicator for measuring rubber's cold resistance. The brittle temperature of rubber has a strong correlation with low-temperature resistance performance, but there is no complete consistency. The brittle temperature does not represent the lower limit of the product's working temperature because actual operating conditions may differ from test conditions. Standard: GB/T 1682-94. Brittle temperature national standard GB/T 1682-94. When testing the brittle temperature of [rubber expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/xiangjiaopengzhangjie/), attention should be paid to the following points: ① Test specimen specifications. The specimen should be 25.0±0.5mm long, 6.0±0.5mm wide, and 2.0±0.3mm thick. ② Heat transfer medium and refrigerant used. Common non-metallic expansion joint heat transfer media include industrial ethanol, as well as acetone and siloxane liquids. Refrigerants include dry ice and liquid nitrogen. ③ Specimen cooling time is 3.0min. ④ The impactor should strike the specimen within half a second. Non-metallic expansion joint resilience is an important indicator for measuring rubber elasticity. It uses a pendulum hammer to impact rubber from a certain height, and the ratio of the rebound height to the original height - the larger this value, the better the rubber's elasticity. Standard: GB/T 1681-91, ISO 4662-1986. When testing non-metallic expansion joint resilience, attention should be paid to the following items: ① [Silicone sealing ring](http://www.smpolymer.com/) specimen dimensions and test specifications: The specimen should be cylindrical, with thickness of 12.5±0.5mm and diameter of 29±0.5mm. If specimens are cut directly from finished products and cannot meet requirements, several layers can be stacked for measurement, but no more than 3 layers, with each layer being parallel and smooth. ② Light exposure should be completely avoided during vulcanization and specimen preparation. ③ If specimens are polished, the interval between polishing and testing should not exceed 72h.
