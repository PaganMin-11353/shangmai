The main material constituting the pipe body of [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) is textile fiber or other special non-metallic materials. It can provide large multi-dimensional compensation within a smaller size range, has no reaction thrust, and the main material is textile fibers and their surface-coated coverings, with no force transmission. Using non-metallic expansion joints can simplify design, avoid using large supports, and save a lot of materials and labor.

[Rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) both have noise reduction and vibration damping functions, good high temperature resistance and corrosion resistance, can effectively reduce noise and vibration in boiler, fan, and other systems, and have relatively good sealing performance.

[Non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) are treated with coating of organic silicon and fluorine polymer materials, capable of providing large axial, angular, and lateral displacement, and are relatively convenient to install.
