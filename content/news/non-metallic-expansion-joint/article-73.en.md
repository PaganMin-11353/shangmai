[Non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) as a type of fabric compensator certainly have the function of resistance to high and low temperatures. What differs from the expansion joints we usually see is that non-metallic expansion joints have excellent compensating effects, complete production and assembly systems, and extremely good sealing performance. The selected fluoroplastics and organic silicon materials have good high-temperature resistance properties, and like many silicone products: [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), they all possess these properties.

The basic structure can be divided into membrane, stainless steel wire mesh, insulation cotton, thermal barrier filler layer, frame, and baffle plate.

The membrane plays an important role in [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/), it can absorb expansion amounts and prevent gas leakage and rainwater infiltration. The stainless steel wire mainly prevents flowing impurities from entering the expansion joint and prevents insulation materials from scattering outward. All components have strong compensating functions and are indispensable.
