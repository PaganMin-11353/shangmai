Non-metallic compensators are also called [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/), and their expansion and contraction function is particularly good, which can protect the safe operation of pipelines. This type of expansion joint utilizes compensation advantages to absorb axial, lateral, and angular thermal deformation of pipelines. The main component of non-metallic expansion joints is the elastic stainless steel bellows, which can freely expand, contract, and bend to compensate for errors. [Rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) can both reduce vibration.

The improvement of equipment protection requires the compensation of [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/), mainly because this type of compensator is convenient to install, has strong practicality, and can be utilized for longer periods than ordinary expansion joints.

For deformations caused by natural disasters such as ground subsidence and earthquakes, these will absolutely not occur with non-metallic expansion joints, as they have strong absorption capabilities for these deformations.
