There are many high temperature resistant rubber products, but for [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/), they are quite rare. It is composed of fiber ring belts, insulation materials, support materials, and metal structural components. Although the composition materials are complex, this does not affect the superiority of non-metallic expansion joints during use. Like many rubber products such as [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), it has the characteristics of no elastic reaction force, corrosion resistance, high temperature resistance, noise reduction and vibration isolation.

It provides multi-directional compensation within a small size range, mainly used to correct deviations during installation.

[Non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) can generally propagate in media such as air and flue gas, and are widely used in industries such as steel, power, cement, and non-ferrous metal smelting.
