General [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) can compensate for axial, lateral, and angular movements, so according to these functions, non-metallic expansion joints can be divided into straight type, compound type, angular type, and square type. Like [rubber shock absorber blocks](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), they all have characteristics of high temperature resistance, corrosion resistance, noise reduction and vibration damping. Due to their no-thrust and simplified support design functions, they are generally suitable for hot air ducts and dust-laden pipelines.

When it comes to the characteristics of expansion joints, there are many, with the main ones being the following: First, non-metallic expansion joints compensate for errors during the installation process, enabling the pipeline connection process to achieve maximum compensatory effect. Second, they have good sealing performance, ensuring leak-free production assembly systems and achieving relatively complete assembly. Finally, non-metallic expansion joints not only have structural advantages but also hold a dominant position in terms of price.

[Non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) are particularly particular about material selection, mainly choosing fluoroplastics and organic silicon materials.
