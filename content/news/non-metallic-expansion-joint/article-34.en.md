Continuing from the previous article, we will discuss [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) in this piece. They can provide large multi-dimensional compensation within relatively small dimensions. Due to the excellent sealing performance of expansion joints, they can be used under various media conditions, and their good sealing properties also bring considerable convenience for installation. [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) also have good sealing performance, with the additional function of isolating vibration transmission.

The reason why non-metallic expansion joints have such high sealing performance is that they use organic silicon, fluorine, and other polymer materials for coating treatment, and also have strong high-temperature resistance and corrosion resistance.

[Non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) are mostly applied to equipment types, such as: air heaters, blowers, and various equipment inlets and outlets. Petrochemical enterprises, such as: flue gas desulfurization devices for boiler industrial furnaces. Thermal power plants, such as: gas turbine exhaust systems, dust removal systems.
