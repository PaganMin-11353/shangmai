[Non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) can provide multi-directional compensation, and their performance is far superior to metallic compensators that can only provide single-type compensation. Rubber products are superior to ordinary fiber textiles, with no force transmission. Non-metallic compensators can effectively reduce noise and vibration in boiler, fan, and other systems. Their simplified design can save large amounts of materials and labor, greatly reducing manufacturing costs. This simplified design is also reflected in [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/) and [V-type sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/).

Good high temperature resistance and corrosion resistance - non-metallic expansion joints use fluoroplastics and organic silicon materials with good high and low pressure resistance performance. The sound isolation and vibration reduction effects are also quite good, as insulation cotton fabric itself has sound absorption and vibration isolation effects, reducing vibration transmission.

[Non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) have the widest applications and can be used in various pipelines and equipment in aerospace, power generation, petrochemical, steel, cement, construction, and other industries. They have also been applied in key projects and have received praise and acclaim from numerous manufacturers.
