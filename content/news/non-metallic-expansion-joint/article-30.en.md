Because expansion joints have certain extensibility, the production of expansion joints also requires certain production standards, especially strict restrictions on materials. Special products in [non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) include [silicone sealing rings](http://www.smpolymer.com/), which have representative significance. Expansion joints can freely stretch, compress, and bend, allowing for bellows modification and design based on expansion joint requirements and combinations.

In fact, bellows expansion joints are able to have extension and compensation functions mainly through the bellows itself, with long service life, corrosion resistance, and easy installation. Therefore, their applications are more widespread, mainly used in pipelines and equipment in aerospace, steel, cement, and other construction industries.

[Non-metallic expansion joints](http://www.smpolymer.com/feijinshupengzhangjie/) have been applied in key projects throughout the country and autonomous regions, deserving promotion.
