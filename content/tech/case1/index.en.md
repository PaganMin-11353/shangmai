## Project Overview

This case study demonstrates our ultra-high pressure sealing component solution developed for a major industrial equipment manufacturer.

### Customer Requirements
- Working pressure: 350 MPa
- Working temperature: -40°C to +180°C
- Medium: hydraulic oil
- Service life: ≥10,000 hours

### Technical Challenges
Facing extreme operating conditions, traditional sealing materials could not meet the requirements for long-term stable operation. It was necessary to develop specialized sealing materials with excellent pressure resistance, temperature resistance, and medium resistance characteristics.

### Solution
Our R&D team used specially formulated nitrile rubber materials and manufactured sealing components that met requirements through precision molding processes:
- Selected high-performance nitrile rubber base material
- Added specialized pressure-resistant additives
- Used multi-step precision molding processes
- Implemented strict quality inspection procedures

### Project Results
- Successfully passed customer's rigorous performance testing
- Actual service life exceeded 15,000 hours
- Received high recognition from customer and established long-term cooperation
- Set industry benchmark for the company in ultra-high pressure sealing field

### Technical Parameters
- Hardness: 85±5 Shore A
- Tensile strength: ≥25 MPa
- Elongation at break: ≥400%
- Compression set: ≤15% (150°C×72h)
